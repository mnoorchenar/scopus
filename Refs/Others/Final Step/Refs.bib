A retrospective review of characteristics, clinical indices, caregiver availability, and patient status (whether living alone) was completed for 304 patients undergoing cardiac surgery over 24 consecutive months. Univariate analyses and multivariable logistic regression models were used to evaluate risk factor characteristics for PLOS greater than 7 days and to predict discharge disposition to TCR or home. Older patients, those with preoperative comorbidities, and those without a caregiver at home experience delays in functional recovery and discharge and are more likely to need TCR services. Our findings support the addition of functional recovery and social support risk items to the preoperative cardiac surgery risk assessment. © 2006 American Academy of Nurse Practitioners.},

	abstract = {Background. The aims of this study were to determine the average length of stay in the Post-anesthesia Care Unit (PACU LOS) in the Philippine General Hospital (PGH) and to create a model that will predict the PACU LOS based on the factors that significantly affect the LOS. Determination and prediction of PACU LOS is essential in resource utilization, and in cost containment and reduction. Addressing the modifiable variables that affect the PACU LOS may lead to an improvement in the LOS of patients in the PACU and, consequently, to better recovery room staffing and a reduced cost for the patients and the hospital. Methods. A prospective chart review of 400 postoperative patients admitted in the PGH PACU was done. Summary statistics were presented. Using the set of variables found to be significant, a regression model was formulated to estimate the PACU LOS. Results. The mean PACU LOS was 4.59 hours. There were significant differences in the mean PACU LOS based on the occurrence of complications. There were also significant differences in the median PACU LOS based on the type and duration of surgery, anesthetic technique, and duration of anesthesia. The multiple linear regression model that best predicted PACU LOS included ASA-PS classification, type of surgery, duration of surgery, anesthetic technique, and occurrence of intraoperative or postoperative complications. Conclusions. The mean PACU LOS of the Philippine Genera Hospital is higher than that of published data. The factors included in the model that best predicts PACU LOS may be studied to improve the PACU LOS. © 2020 University of the Philippines Manila. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Investigators in clinical research are often interested in determining the association between patient characteristics and post-operative length of stay (LOS). We examined the relative performance of seven different statistical strategies for analyzing LOS in a cohort of patients undergoing CABG surgery. We compared linear regression: linear regression with log-transformed length of stay; generalized linear models with the following distributions: Poisson, negative binomial, normal, and gamma; and semi-parametric survival models. Nine of twenty patient characteristics were found to be significantly associated with increased LOS in all models. The models disagreed upon the statistical significance of the association between the remaining patient characteristics and increased LOS. Generalized linear models with Poisson, negative binomial, and gamma distributions, and the Cox regression model demonstrated the greatest consistency. With the exception of Cox regression, all models had similar ability to predict length of stay in the actual data. However, the generalized linear models tended to have marginally lower prediction error than the linear models. Using four measures of prediction error, Cox regression had substantially higher prediction error than the other models. Generalized linear models were best able to predict patient length of stay in Monte Carlo simulations that were performed. Researchers should consider generalized linear models with normal, Poisson, or negative binomial distributions for predicting length of stay following CABG surgery. Post-operative length of stay is a complex phenomenon that is difficult to incorporate into a simple parametric model due to a small proportion of patients having very long lengths of stay.},

	doi = {10.1007/s10916-024-02085-9},
	abstract = {Background: Despite low mortality for elective procedures in the United States and developed countries, some patients have unexpected care escalations (UCE) following post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) discharge. Studies indicate patient risk factors for UCE, but determining which factors are most important is unclear. Machine learning (ML) can predict clinical events. We hypothesized that ML could predict patient UCE after PACU discharge in surgical patients and identify specific risk factors. Methods: We conducted a single center, retrospective analysis of all patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery (elective and emergent). We collected data from pre-operative visits, intra-operative records, PACU admissions, and the rate of UCE. We trained a ML model with this data and tested the model on an independent data set to determine its efficacy. Finally, we evaluated the individual patient and clinical factors most likely to predict UCE risk. Results: Our study revealed that ML could predict UCE risk which was approximately 5% in both the training and testing groups. We were able to identify patient risk factors such as patient vital signs, emergent procedure, ASA Status, and non-surgical anesthesia time as significant variable. We plotted Shapley values for significant variables for each patient to help determine which of these variables had the greatest effect on UCE risk. Of note, the UCE risk factors identified frequently by ML were in alignment with anesthesiologist clinical practice and the current literature. Conclusions: We used ML to analyze data from a single-center, retrospective cohort of non-cardiac surgical patients, some of whom had an UCE. ML assigned risk prediction for patients to have UCE and determined perioperative factors associated with increased risk. We advocate to use ML to augment anesthesiologist clinical decision-making, help decide proper disposition from the PACU, and ensure the safest possible care of our patients. © The Author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {Background: The aim of this study is to develop a predictive model utilizing deep learning and machine learning techniques that will inform clinical decision-making by predicting the 1-year postoperative recovery of patients with lumbar disk herniation. Methods: The clinical data of 470 inpatients who underwent tubular microdiscectomy (TMD) between January 2018 and January 2021 were retrospectively analyzed as variables. The dataset was randomly divided into a training set (n = 329) and a test set (n = 141) using a 10-fold cross-validation technique. Various deep learning and machine learning algorithms including Random Forests, Extreme Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Machines, Extra Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, Light Gradient Boosting Machine, and MLP (Artificial Neural Networks) were employed to develop predictive models for the recovery of patients with lumbar disk herniation 1 year after surgery. The cure rate score of lumbar JOA score 1 year after TMD was used as an outcome indicator. The primary evaluation metric was the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), with additional measures including decision curve analysis (DCA), accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and others. Results: The heat map of the correlation matrix revealed low inter-feature correlation. The predictive model employing both machine learning and deep learning algorithms was constructed using 15 variables after feature engineering. Among the eight algorithms utilized, the MLP algorithm demonstrated the best performance. Conclusion: Our study findings demonstrate that the MLP algorithm provides superior predictive performance for the recovery of patients with lumbar disk herniation 1 year after surgery.

	abstract = {Background: Unplanned postoperative intensive care unit admissions (UIAs) are rare events that cause significant challenges to perioperative workflow. We describe the development of a machine-learning derived model to predict UIAs using only widely used preoperative variables. Methods: This was a 3-year retrospective review of all adult surgeries under the General, Vascular, and Thoracic surgical services with anticipated length of greater than 180 minutes at a single institution. A UIA was defined as any post-operative patient recovering in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) requiring direct transfer to the intensive care unit (ICU) for higher level of care. We developed our prediction model with a gradient-boosting decision tree algorithm (XGBoost). The model incorporated sixteen generalizable predictor variables that were derived from the demographics and surgical booking details. Validation and evaluation were performed with 10-fold cross validation, and model performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratio. Results: A total of 4658 patients were included for analysis. The incidence of UIAs was 2.3%. With 10-fold cross validation, the area under the ROC curve was 0.80 (95% CI 0.74–0.86). Two decision thresholds were used, which achieved the best specificity of 94% (95% CI 92–96%), best positive likelihood ratio of 4.22 (95% CI 0.99–8.79), and best sensitivity of 82% (95% CI 58–100%). Conclusions: Our machine learning-derived model is a reliable tool for the perioperative clinician to predict a rare outcome in high-risk patients using only preoperative variables. Future studies will include prospective validation of this model at other institutions and real-time incorporation for improvement in perioperative workflow. © The Author(s) 2025.},

	abstract = {Background: Catheter-related bladder discomfort (CRBD) commonly occurs in patients who have indwelling urinary catheters while under general anesthesia. And moderate-to-severe CRBD can lead to significant adverse events and negatively impact patient health outcomes. However, current screening studies for patients experiencing moderate-to-severe CRBD after waking from general anesthesia are insufficient. Constructing predictive models with higher accuracy using multiple machine learning techniques for early identification of patients at risk of experiencing moderate-to-severe CRBD during general anesthesia resuscitation. Methods: Eight hundred forty-six patients with indwelling urinary catheters who were resuscitated in a post-anesthesia care unit (PACU). Trained researchers used the CRBD 4-level assessment method to evaluate the severity of a patient’s CRBD. They then inputted 24 predictors into six different machine learning algorithms. The performance of the models was evaluated using metrics like the area under the curve (AUC). Results: The AUCs of the six models ranged from 0.82 to 0.89. Among them, the RF model displayed the highest predictive ability, with an AUC of 0.89 (95%CI: 0.87, 0.91). Additionally, it achieved an accuracy of 0.93 (95%CI: 0.91, 0.95), 0.80 sensitivity, 0.98 specificity, 0.94 positive predictive value (PPV), 0.92 negative predictive value (NPV), 0.87 F1 score, and 0.07 Brier score. The logistic regression (LR) model has achieved good results (AUC:0.87) and converted into a nomogram. Conclusions: The study has successfully developed a machine learning prediction model that exhibits excellent predictive capabilities in identifying patients who may develop moderate-to-severe CRBD after undergoing general anesthesia. Furthermore, the study also presents a nomogram, which serves as a valuable tool for clinical healthcare professionals, enabling them to intervene at an early stage for better patient outcomes. © The Author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {Background: The relative proportion of clinical compared with nonclinical influences on length of stay after colectomy has never been measured. We developed a novel machine-learning framework that quantifies the proportion of length of stay after colectomy attributable to clinical factors and infers the overall impact of nonclinical influences. Study Design: Patients who underwent partial colectomy, total colectomy, or low anterior resection included in American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement were analyzed. Multivariable linear regression, random forest, and neural network models were developed to assess the impact of 56 clinical variables on length of stay. The random forest and neural network models were fine-tuned to maximize the explanatory power of clinical variables on length of stay. R2 measured the proportion of length of stay explained by clinical factors. The contribution of nonclinical factors was inferred from residual analysis. Mean absolute error was used to measure the discrepancy between actual and model-predicted length of stay. Results: Of 96,081 patients, 71% underwent partial colectomy (mean length of stay, 6.8 days; standard deviation, 5.6), 27% low anterior resection (5.4; 4.4), and 2% total colectomy (11.8; 7.1). Clinical factors in multivariable linear regression models accounted for only 29–54% of length of stay variability. The random forest and neural network models demonstrated persistent unexplained length of stay variability even when considering nonlinear interactions (R2: random forest [range, 0.46–0.55]; neural network [range, 0.44–0.57]), consistent with multivariable linear regression models. Mean absolute error showed clinical factors could not account for 2–2.5 days of length of stay after low anterior resection and partial colectomy, and 4 days after total colectomy. Conclusion: This is the first study to quantify the overall influence of clinical factors on post-colectomy length of stay, revealing they explain less than 55% of variability. By maximizing clinical factors' explanatory impact using machine learning, the remaining variability is inferred to be nonclinical. Our findings provide hospitals with a novel paradigm to indirectly measure the influence of previously elusive nonclinical factors. © 2025 Elsevier Inc.},

Design: Retrospective observational study. Setting: Post-anaesthesia care unit. Patients: Outpatient surgical patients discharged on the same day in a large academic institution. Preoperative data were collected. The study period was three months in 2016. Measurements: Prolonged PACU stay defined as a length of stay longer than the third quartile.

Main results: Four strong predictors for prolonged PACU stay: general anaesthesia, obstructive sleep apnoea, surgical specialty and scheduled case duration. Our model had an excellent discrimination performance and a good calibration. Conclusion: We developed a predictive model for prolonged PACU stay in our institution. This model is different from the UCSD model probably secondary to local and regional differences in outpatient surgery practice.

Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) was used to screen variables. A logistic regression model was built on variables determined by a combined method of forward selection and backward elimination. Nomogram was designed with the model. The nomogram performance was evaluated with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for discrimination, calibration plot for consistency between predictions and actuality, and decision curve analysis (DCA) for clinical application value. Results: A nomogram was established based on the selected ten variables, including age, BMI < 21 kg/m2, American society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status (ASA), surgery type, chill, delirium, pain, naloxone, operation duration and blood transfusion. The C-index value was 0.773 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.765 - 0.781] in the development set and 0.757 (95% CI = 0.744-0.770) in the validation set. The AUC was > 0.75 for the prediction of PLOS in PACU. The calibration curves revealed high consistencies between the predicted and actual probability.

Although previous studies identified some predictors, there is not a model that only utilizes various patients demographic and comorbidities, that are already known preoperatively, and that may affect PACU length of stay for outpatient procedures requiring the care of an anesthesiologist. METHODS: We collected data from 4151 patients at a single institution from 2014 to 2015. The data set was split into a training set (cases before 2015) and a test set (cases during 2015). Bootstrap samples were chosen (R = 1000 replicates) and a logistic regression model was built on the samples using a combined method of forward selection and backward elimination based on the Akaike Information Criterion. The trained model was applied to the test set. Model performance was evaluated with the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) Curve (AUC) for discrimination and the Hosmer-Lemeshow (HL) test for goodness-of-fit. RESULTS: The final model had 5 predictor variables for prolonged PACU length of stay, which included the following: Morbid obesity, hypertension, surgical specialty, primary anesthesia type, and scheduled case duration. The model had an AUC value of 0.754 (95% confidence interval 0.733-0.774) on the training set and 0.722 (95% confidence interval 0.698-0.747) on the test set, with no difference between the 2 ROC curves (P = .06). The model had good calibration for the data in both the training and test data set indicated by nonsignificant P values from the HL test (P = .211 and .719 for the training and test set, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: We developed a predictive model with excellent discrimination and goodnessof- fit that can help identify those at higher odds for extended PACU length of stay.

A model, which can predict the results of PACU stays, could improve the utilization of PACU and operating room resources through a more efficient arrangement. The purpose of study was to compare the performance of neural network to logistic regression analysis using clinical sets of data from adult patients undergoing general anesthesia. An artificial neural network was trained with 409 clinical sets using backward error propagation and validated through independent testing of 183 records. Twenty-two inputs were used to find determinants and to predict categorical values. Logistic regression analysis was performed to provide a comparison. The neural network correctly predicted in 81.4% of situations and identified discriminating variables (intubated state, sex, neuromuscular blocker and intraoperative use of opioid), whereas the figure was 65.0% in logistic regression analysis. We concluded that the neural network could provide a useful predictive model for the optimization of limited resources. The neural network is a new alternative classifying method for developing a predictive paradigm, and it has a higher classifying performance compared to the logistic regression model.

We developed an AI-based novel predictive LOS score for advanced-stage high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) patients following cytoreductive surgery and refined factors significantly affecting LOS. (2) Methods: Machine learning and deep learning methods using artificial neural networks (ANN) were used together with conventional logistic regression to predict continuous and binary LOS outcomes for HGSOC patients. The models were evaluated in a post-hoc internal validation set and a Graphical User Interface (GUI) was developed to demonstrate the clinical feasibility of sophisticated LOS predictions. (3) Results: For binary LOS predictions at differential time points, the accuracy ranged between 70–98%. Feature selection identified surgical complexity, pre-surgery albumin, blood loss, operative time, bowel resection with stoma formation, and severe postoperative complications (CD3–5) as independent LOS predictors. For the GUI numerical LOS score, the ANN model was a good estimator for the standard deviation of the LOS distribution by ± two days. (4) Conclusions: We demonstrated the development and application of both quantitative and qualitative AI models to predict LOS in advanced-stage EOC patients following their cytoreduction. Accurate identification of potentially modifiable factors delaying hospital discharge can further inform services performing root cause analysis of LOS. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this study was to develop a predictive model for length of stay (LOS) after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Between 2013 and 2014, 1,826 patients who underwent TKA from a single Singapore center were enrolled in the study after qualification. Demographics of patients with normal and prolonged LOS were analyzed. The risk variables that could affect LOS were identified by univariate analysis. Predictive models for LOS after TKA by logistic regression or machine learning were constructed and compared. The univariate analysis showed that age, American Society of Anesthesiologist level, diabetes, ischemic heart disease, congestive heart failure, general anesthesia, and operation duration were risk factors that could affect LOS (p < 0.05). Comparing with logistic regression models, the machine learning model with all variables was the best model to predict LOS after TKA, of whose area of operator characteristic curve was 0.738. Machine learning algorithms improved the predictive performance of LOS prediction models for TKA patients. © 2022 Georg Thieme Verlag. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This research aimed to develop a machine learning model to predict the potential risk of prolonged length of stay in hospital before operation, which can be used to strengthen patient management. Methods: Patients who underwent posterior spinal deformity surgery (PSDS) from eleven medical institutions in China between 2015 and 2022 were included. Detailed preoperative patient data, including demographics, medical history, comorbidities, preoperative laboratory results, and surgery details, were collected from their electronic medical records. The cohort was randomly divided into a training dataset and a validation dataset with a ratio of 70:30. Based on Boruta algorithm, nine different machine learning algorithms and a stack ensemble model were trained after hyperparameters tuning visualization and evaluated on the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), precision-recall curve, calibration, and decision curve analysis. Visualization of Shapley Additive exPlanations method finally contributed to explaining model prediction. Results: Of the 162 included patients, the K Nearest Neighbors algorithm performed the best in the validation group compared with other machine learning models (yielding an AUROC of 0.8191 and PRAUC of 0.6175). The top five contributing variables were the preoperative hemoglobin, height, body mass index, age, and preoperative white blood cells. A web-based calculator was further developed to improve the predictive model's clinical operability. Conclusions: Our study established and validated a clinical predictive model for prolonged postoperative hospitalization duration in patients who underwent PSDS, which offered valuable prognostic information for preoperative planning and postoperative care for clinicians.

Methods The medical records from patients of both sexes, aged 4 0 - 8 0 yr, of American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status classification I — HI, transferred to PACU with tracheal intubation after radical esophagectomy under general anesthesia in our hospital from January 2019 to December 2020, were retrospectively collected. The patient's age, gender, American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status classification, smoking history, drinking history, history of non-thoracic surgery, history of hypertension, history of diabetes mellitus, preoperative anemia, respiratory diseases, doses of anesthetics, preoperative nerve block, intraoperative consumption of opioids and dexmedetomidine, operation method (thoracotomy and endoscopic surgery), operation time, usage of vascular drugs, bradycardia, hypotension, red blood cell infusion, plasma infusion, total infusion volume, blood loss and urine volume were collected. The extubation time in PACU, visual analog scale scores at rest at 10 min after extubation, consumption of rescue analgesics in PACU, hypoxemia after extubation, and occurrence of nausea and vomiting were also collected. Patients were divided into PACU-LOS normal group (PACU-LOS ^ 2 h) and PACU-LOS prolonged group (PACU-L0S>2 h) according to the PACU-LOS. Logistic regression analysis was used to identity the risk factors for prolonged PACU-LOS in the patients undergoing radical esophagectomy, and the predictive model was established and verified. The receiver operating characteristic curves were used to evaluate the model discrimination and Hosmer-Lemshow goodness-of-fit test was used to evaluate the consistency of the model. Results A total of 943 patients were included in this study, and the incidence of prolonged PACU-LOS was 15.7%. The results of logistic regression analysis showed that chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR = 4.900, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.512-9.556), increasing age (OR = 22.154, 95% CI 6.736-73.003), prolonged time of extubation (OR= 1.214, 95% CI 1.174-1.256) and hypoxemia after extubation (0i? = 4.891, 95% CI 2.167-11.039) were risk factors for prolonged PACU-LOS, and the preoperative use of nerve block (Otf = 0.358, 95% CI 0.190-0.672) was a protective factor for prolonged PACU-LOS in the patients undergoing radical esophagectomy (P<0.05). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (9 5 % CI) was 0.947 (0.925-0.963), the sensitivity was 0.878, and the specificity was 0.906. The internal validation of the prediction model was carried out using the receiver operating characteristic curve in the validation set, and the area under the curve (9 5 % CI) was 0.942 (0 . 8 9 5 - 0 . 9 4 2, P<0.001) and the Youden index was 0.784. The line chart prediction model was developed. The prediction analysis model was verified by Hosmer-Lemshow test, P<0.001, and the C-index visualized line chart prediction model was 0.946. Conclusions Preoperative chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, increasing age, prolonged time of extubation and hypoxemia after extubation are risk factors for prolonged PACU-LOS, and preoperative use of nerve block is a protective factor for prolonged PACU-LOS. The risk prediction model developed can effectively predict the occurrence of prolonged PACU-LOS in the patients undergoing radical esophagectomy. © 2024 Chinese Medical Journals Publishing House Co.Ltd.

	doi = {10.3389/fsurg.2022.925354},
	abstract = {Objective: The purpose of this study was to develop and internally validate a prediction nomogram model in patients undergoing lumbar fusion surgery. Methods: A total of 310 patients undergoing lumbar fusion surgery were reviewed, and the median and quartile interval were used to describe postoperative length of stay (PLOS). Patients with PLOS > P75 were defined as prolonged PLOS. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression was used to filter variables for building the prolonged PLOS risk model. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was applied to build a predictive model using the variables selected in the LASSO regression model. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) of the predicting model was calculated and significant test was performed. The Kappa consistency test between the predictive model and the actual diagnosis was performed. Discrimination, calibration, and the clinical usefulness of the predicting model were assessed using the C-index, calibration plot, and decision curve analysis. Internal validation was assessed using the bootstrapping validation. Results: According to the interquartile range of PLOS in a total of 310 patients, the PLOS of 235 patients was ≤P75 (7 days) (normal PLOS), and the PLOS of 75 patients was > P75 (prolonged PLOS). The LASSO selected predictors that were used to build the prediction nomogram included BMI, diabetes, hypertension, duration of surgery, duration of anesthesia, anesthesia type, intraoperative blood loss, sufentanil for postoperative analgesia, and postoperative complication. The model displayed good discrimination with an AUC value of 0.807 (95% CI: 0.758–0.849, P < 0.001), a Kappa value of 0.5186 (cutoff value, 0.2445, P < 0.001), and good calibration. A high C-index value of 0.776 could still be reached in the interval validation. Decision curve analysis showed that the prolonged PLOS nomogram was clinically useful when intervention was decided at the prolonged PLOS possibility threshold of 3%. Conclusions: This study developed a novel nomogram with a relatively good accuracy to help clinicians access the risk of prolonged PLOS in lumbar fusion surgery patients. By an estimate of individual risk, surgeons and anesthesiologists may shorten PLOS and accelerate postoperative recovery of lumbar fusion surgery through more accurate individualized treatment. 2022 Lu, Huang, Chen and Wu.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Accurate and timely discharge from the Post-Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU) is essential to prevent postoperative complications and optimize hospital resource utilization. Premature discharge can lead to severe issues such as respiratory or cardiovascular complications, while delays can strain hospital capacity. Machine learning algorithms offer a promising solution by leveraging large amounts of patient data to predict optimal discharge times. Unlike prior studies relying on statistical models or single-algorithm methods, this research assesses multiple ML models to predict discharge readiness, comparing them against staff evaluations and the Aldrete checklist. Methodology: We conducted a cross-sectional study of 830 patients under general anesthesia from December 2023 to April 2024, collecting demographics, surgical details, and Aldrete scores. A power analysis ensured statistical robustness, targeting a 5% accuracy improvement (minimum clinically important difference, derived from Gabriel et al., 2017), with variance (SD ≈ 0.1) from pilot data, using a two-sample t-test (power = 0.8, alpha = 0.05), confirming the sample size’s adequacy. Two prediction approaches were tested: discharge timing in 15-minute intervals and binary classification (within 15 min or later). Models included Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Tree (DT), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and XGBoost, assessed via accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC. Predictions were benchmarked against staff and Aldrete scores, with 99.5% confidence intervals (CIs) adjusting for multiple comparisons. Results: he RF algorithm showed high performance in both prediction approaches. In the first approach, RF achieved an AUC of 0.75 (99.5% CI: 0.70–0.80) and accuracy of 0.87 (99.5% CI: 0.83–0.91) per staff evaluations, and an AUC of 0.87 (99.5% CI: 0.83–0.91) and accuracy of 0.71 (99.5% CI: 0.66–0.76) per Aldrete scores. In the second approach, RF recorded an AUC of 0.85 (99.5% CI: 0.81–0.89) and accuracy of 0.86 (99.5% CI: 0.82–0.90) per staff evaluations, with ANN also showing strong results (AUC = 0.88, 99.5% CI: 0.84–0.92; accuracy = 0.78, 99.5% CI: 0.74–0.82). Due to overlapping CIs, differences between models were not statistically significant (P >.005). According to the Aldrete checklist, RF, SVM, and ANN exhibited competitive predictive capability, with AUCs ranging from 0.80 to 0.86. Conclusion: The strong performance of Random Forest (RF) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models in predicting PACU discharge timing upon admission highlights their potential as effective tools for evaluating discharge readiness, as compared to staff assessments and the Aldrete checklist. This study focused on assessing these models, showing their ability to produce consistent predictions, though differences between top models were not statistically significant due to overlapping confidence intervals. Practical application of these findings to improve patient outcomes or hospital efficiency requires further investigation. © The Author(s) 2025.},

	abstract = {Aims: The objective of this study was to investigate the risk factors for post-operative hypothermia in adult patients and to develop a prediction model. Background: Post-operative hypothermia is one of the most common complications and thus increases the degree of clinical and nursing risk. The previous studies mainly focused on intraoperative or post-operative hypothermia with limited data. Design: Cohort study. Methods: A total of 99,644 records including anaesthesia and post-anesthesia care files were retrieved from October 1, 2021 to February 10, 2023, including 89,663 files in the training group and 9981 files in the validation group. The primary outcome was the incidence of post-operative hypothermia in the post-anesthesia care unit. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify risk factors for post-operative hypothermia. A logistic regression nomogram was subsequently created to predict the probability of post-operative hypothermia during the post-anesthesia care unit stay. Results: The independent risk factors for post-operative hypothermia included male sex, age, low body mass index, anaesthesia duration, chest surgery and urological surgery. A nomogram was established to predict the probability of post-operative hypothermia during the post-anesthesia care unit stay. In the model, the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve values in the training and validation groups were 0.86 and 0.87, respectively. The Brier scores in the training and validation groups were 3.46% and 3.34%, respectively. Conclusions: In this study, the incidence of post-operative hypothermia was 3.6%. The following variables are independently associated with post-operative hypothermia: age, male sex, BMI, duration of anaesthesia, surgical type and anaesthesia type. A novel prediction model is feasible for predicting the probability of post-operative hypothermia during the post-anaesthesia care unit stay. Reporting Method: TRIPOD + AI checklist. Relevance to Clinical Practice: Nurses can utilise the predictive model to assess the risk of post-operative hypothermia, offering valuable guidance for implementing preventive measures.

	abstract = {Background and objectives Currently, no evidence-based criteria exist for decision making in the post anesthesia care unit (PACU). This could be valuable for the allocation of postoperative patients to the appropriate level of care and beneficial for patient outcomes such as unanticipated intensive care unit (ICU) admissions. The aim is to assess whether the inclusion of intra- and postoperative factors improves the prediction of postoperative patient deterioration and unanticipated ICU admissions. Methods A retrospective observational cohort study was performed between January 2013 and December 2017 in a tertiary Dutch hospital. All patients undergoing surgery in the study period were selected. Cardiothoracic surgeries, obstetric surgeries, catheterization lab procedures, electroconvulsive therapy, day care procedures, intravenous line interventions and patients under the age of 18 years were excluded. The primary outcome was unanticipated ICU admission. Results An unanticipated ICU admission complicated the recovery of 223 (0.9%) patients. These patients had higher hospital mortality rates (13.9% versus 0.2%, p<0.001). Multivariable analysis resulted in predictors of unanticipated ICU admissions consisting of age, body mass index, general anesthesia in combination with epidural anesthesia, preoperative score, diabetes, administration of vasopressors, erythrocytes, duration of surgery and post anesthesia care unit stay, and vital parameters such as heart rate and oxygen saturation. The receiver operating characteristic curve of this model resulted in an area under the curve of 0.86 (95% CI 0.83–0.88). Conclusions The prediction of unanticipated ICU admissions from electronic medical record data improved when the intra- and early postoperative factors were combined with preoperative patient factors. This emphasizes the need for clinical decision support tools in post anesthesia care units with regard to postoperative patient allocation. © 2023 Mestrom et al.

	abstract = {This prospective cohort analysis compared the efficiency of time-based discharge criteria (Group 1) to a modified clinical scoring system (Group 2), incorporating the assessment of pain and temperature, in the post anaesthesia care unit (PACU). Two consecutive series of patients (n=292) were assessed following general anaesthesia for various surgical procedures. The time taken for patients to satisfy their respective discharge criteria was recorded as PACU length of stay (LOS). Patient group and other factors that may have influenced PACU-LOS were examined using time-to-event analysis. The raw PACU-LOS was not shown to be different between the two groups (log rank test, P=0.12). Covariate adjusted estimates were used to compare the two discharge criteria and also to identify other factors influencing PACU-LOS. The Cox regression model was poorly specified and a log-logistic accelerated failure time model was found to be the most parsimonious predictive model. Predictors of decreased PACU-LOS were the treatment group (Group 2 versus Group 1) and the covariate recording anaesthetic airway choice (no endotracheal tube (ETT) versus ETT). Surgical time, as a linear function, intra- and postoperative opioid administration, as well as postoperative antiemetic use were predictors of increased PACU-LOS. Patient age, gender, urgency of surgery, and ASA classification were not predictive of PACU-LOS. Using covariate adjusted estimates, the new PACU discharge criteria, based on the Aldrete's scoring system, was associated with a significantly reduced PACU-LOS in comparison with time-based criteria.},

	abstract = {Background: Postoperative high-activity delirium (PDHA) manifests as a high alertness, restlessness, hallucinations, and delusions. Occurrence of PDHA represents an increased risk of poor prognosis for patients. Objective: To establish and validate a nomogram prediction model for high-activity delirium after non-cardiac surgery in a post-anesthesia care unit (PACU). Methods: This study retrospectively enrolled adult patients who underwent non-cardiac surgery and were observed in the PACU as training data. Patients were divided into PDHA (199 patients) and non-PDHA (396 patients) groups. Patients’ general data, preoperative indicators, intraoperative conditions, and postoperative PACU conditions were collected. The risk factors for PDHA were identified using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. A predictive column chart was created using R language. Adult patients who underwent non-cardiac surgery and entered the PACU for observation were randomly selected as the validation set data (198 cases) for model performance validation. Results: The incidence rate of adult PDHA in the PACU was 0.275%. Sex, age, smoking history, low preoperative albumin level, Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification, anesthesia duration, and postoperative PACU pain score were independent risk factors for hyperactive delirium in PACU adults. In this study, an adult PACU PDHA nomogram prediction model was developed. The training dataset verified that the ROC curve (area under the curve) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were 0.936 (0.917–0.955). The ROC curve of the validation data row showed that the area under the curve and 95% CI were 0.926 (0.885–0.967). Conclusion: The nomogram predictive model for PACU adult high-activity delirium constructed in this study showed good predictive performance. This model could enable the visualization and graphical prediction of adult high-activity delirium occurrence after PACU, which has clinical value. © 2024 Tu et al.},

	abstract = {The post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) length of stay is an important perioperative efficiency metric. The aim of this study was to develop machine learning models to predict ambulatory surgery patients at risk for prolonged PACU length of stay - using only pre-operatively identified factors - and then to simulate the effectiveness in reducing the need for after-hours PACU staffing. Several machine learning classifier models were built to predict prolonged PACU length of stay (defined as PACU stay ≥ 3 hours) on a training set. A case resequencing exercise was then performed on the test set, in which historic cases were re-sequenced based on the predicted risk for prolonged PACU length of stay. The frequency of patients remaining in the PACU after-hours (≥ 7:00 pm) were compared between the simulated operating days versus actual operating room days. There were 10,928 ambulatory surgical patients included in the analysis, of which 580 (5.31%) had a PACU length of stay ≥ 3 hours. XGBoost with SMOTE performed the best (AUC = 0.712). The case resequencing exercise utilizing the XGBoost model resulted in an over three-fold improvement in the number of days in which patients would be in the PACU past 7pm as compared with historic performance (41% versus 12%, P<0.0001). Predictive models using preoperative patient characteristics may allow for optimized case sequencing, which may mitigate the effects of prolonged PACU lengths of stay on after-hours staffing utilization. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Objective: We aimed to analyze the factors related to delay in transfer of patients in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) and to develop and validate a prediction model for understanding these factors to guide precise clinical intervention. Methods: We collected data from two cohorts of 1153 and 297 patients who underwent surgery and were treated in the PACU at two time points. We examined their clinical features and anesthesia care data using analytical methods such as logistic regression, Random Forest, and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (Xgboost) to screen out variables and establish a prediction model. We then validated and simplified the model and plotted a nomogram. Using LASSO regression, we reduced the dimensionality of the data. We developed multiple models and plotted receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and calibration curves. We then constructed a simplified model by pooling the identified variables, which included hemoglobin (HB), alanine transaminase (ALT), glucose levels, duration of anesthesia, and the minimum bispectral index value (BIS_min). Results: The model had good prediction performance parameters in the training and validation sets, with an AUC of 0.909 (0.887– 0.932) in the training set and 0.939 (0.919–0.959) in the validation set. When we compared model 6 with other models, the net reclassification index (NRI) and the integrated discriminant improvement (IDI) index indicated that it did not differ significantly from the other models. We developed a scoring system, and it showed good prediction performance when verified with the training and validation sets as well as external data. Additionally, both the decision curve analysis (DCA) and clinical impact curve (CIC) demonstrated the potential clinical efficacy of the model in guiding patient interventions. Conclusion: Predicting transfer delays in the post-anesthesia care unit using predictive models is feasible; however, this merits further exploration. © 2024 Xie et al.},

	abstract = {It is significant for anesthesiologists to have a precise grasp of the recovery time of the patient after anesthesia. Accurate prediction of anesthesia recovery time can support anesthesiologist decision-making during surgery to help reduce the risk of surgery in patients. However, effective models are not proposed to solve this problem for anesthesiologists. In this paper, we seek to find effective forecasting methods. First, we collect 1824 patient anesthesia data from the eye center and then performed data preprocessing. We extracted 85 variables to predict recovery time from anesthesia. Second, we extract anesthesia information between variables for prediction using machine learning methods, including Bayesian ridge, lightGBM, random forest, support vector regression, and extreme gradient boosting. We also design simple deep learning models as prediction models, including linear residual neural networks and jumping knowledge linear neural networks. Lastly, we perform a comparative experiment of the above methods on the dataset. The experiment demonstrates that the machine learning method performs better than the deep learning model mentioned above on a small number of samples. We find random forest and XGBoost are more efficient than other methods to extract information between variables on postoperative anesthesia recovery time. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {In this pooled analysis of two randomized clinical trials, intraoperative opioid dosing based on the nociception level-index produced less pain compared to standard care with a difference in pain scores in the post-anesthesia care unit of 1.5 (95% CI 0.8–2.2) points on an 11-point scale. The proportion of patients with severe pain was lower by 70%. Severe postoperative pain remains a significant problem and associates with several adverse outcomes. Here, we determined whether the application of a monitor that detects intraoperative nociceptive events, based on machine learning technology, and treatment of such events reduces pain scores in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU). To that end, we performed a pooled analysis of two trials in adult patients, undergoing elective major abdominal surgery, on the effect of intraoperative nociception level monitor (NOL)-guided fentanyl dosing on PACU pain was performed. Patients received NOL-guided fentanyl dosing or standard care (fentanyl dosing based on hemodynamic parameters). Goal of the intervention was to keep NOL at values that indicated absence of nociception. The primary endpoint of the study was the median pain score obtained in the first 90 min in the PACU. Pain scores were collected at 15 min intervals on an 11-point Likert scale. Data from 125 patients (55 men, 70 women, age range 21–86 years) were analyzed. Sixty-one patients received NOL-guided fentanyl dosing and 64 standard care. Median PACU pain score was 1.5 points (0.8–2.2) lower in the NOL group compared to the standard care; the proportion of patients with severe pain was 70% lower in the NOL group (p = 0.045). The only significant factor associated with increased odds for severe pain was the standard of care compared to NOL treatment (OR 6.0, 95% CI 1.4 −25.9, p = 0.017). The use of a machine learning-based technology to guide opioid dosing during major abdominal surgery resulted in reduced PACU pain scores with less patients in severe pain. 2023 van der Wal, Meijer, Fuica, Silman, Boon, Martini, van Velzen, Dahan, Niesters and Gozal.},

	abstract = {Hospital managers must plan and schedule their operating rooms (ORs) and related units to increase productivity and deliver high-quality care. In this situation, some surgery parameters, like surgery and recovery times, are subject to uncertainty due to the unstable environment of hospital processes. Therefore, efficient methodologies should be designed to address these uncertainty sources and provide acceptable solutions in a reasonable time. Typically, solving the problem involves simulation-optimization approaches known to be time-consuming. This work presents a new data mining-optimization approach for integrated ORs and post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) scheduling, known as the operating theater room (OTR) scheduling problem, under uncertainty in surgery and PACU times. Concerning the complexity of the problem, we design four metaheuristics, including genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), simulated annealing (SA), and tabu search (TS) based on the problem features to search the solution space. Our presented approach aims to improve the traditional simulation-optimization frameworks, and utilizes simulation experiment results to train an artificial neural network (ANN), which evaluates the generated sequences of metaheuristic algorithms. The goal is to optimize the patients’ scheduling to minimize the problems’ single objective function. Two cases of the problem are defined based on makespan and total tardiness objectives. Extensive analysis of the results is established by providing three different sizes of example categories from the literature with several probability distributions for surgery and PACU times of patients. The input parameters of metaheuristic algorithms are tunned using the Taguchi design of experiments method, and the results are analyzed using several computational measures. The analysis of results reveals that GA performs better than the other algorithms regarding the solution quality measure for both cases. For the makespan objective case, the average relative percentage deviation (RPD) of GA is zero, while for PSO, SA, and TS, the deviations are 0.03, 0.01, and 0.04, respectively. This difference becomes even more pronounced in the total tardiness objective case, where the average RPD of GA is 0.04, compared to 0.36, 0.41, and 0.84 for PSO, SA, and TS, respectively. Finally, analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Kruskal–Wallis tests are utilized as parametric and non-parametric tests for statistical comparisons. The p value of the conducted tests is less than 0.05 at the 0.05 significance level, confirming a significant difference in the performance of the algorithms. Some managerial insights and practical implications are presented based on obtained results. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2025.},

	abstract = {Introduction: The need for innovative technology in healthcare is apparent due to challenges posed by the lack of resources. This study investigates the adoption of AI-based systems, specifically within the postanesthesia care unit (PACU). The aim of the study was to explore staff needs and expectations concerning the development and implementation of a digital patient flow system based on ML predictions. Methods: A qualitative approach was employed, gathering insights through interviews with 20 healthcare professionals, including nurse managers and staff involved in planning patient flows and patient care. The interview data were analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis, following steps of data familiarization, coding, and theme generation. The resulting themes were then assessed for their alignment with the modified technology acceptance model (TAM2). Results: The respondents discussed the benefits and drawbacks of the proposed ML system versus current manual planning. They emphasized the need for controlling PACU throughput and expected the ML system to improve the length of stay predictions and provide a comprehensive patient flow overview for staff. Prioritizing the patient was deemed important, with the ML system potentially allowing for more patient interaction time. However, concerns were raised regarding potential breaches of patient confidentiality in the new ML system. The respondents suggested new communication strategies might emerge with effective digital information use, possibly freeing up time for more human interaction. While most respondents were optimistic about adapting to the new technology, they recognized not all colleagues might be as convinced. Conclusion: This study showed that respondents were largely favorable toward implementing the proposed ML system, highlighting the critical role of nurse managers in patient workflow and safety, and noting that digitization could offer substantial assistance. Furthermore, the findings underscore the importance of strong leadership and effective communication as key factors for the successful implementation of such systems.

Methods: We analyzed hospital registry data from patients who received anesthesia care in ambulatory surgery centres (ASCs) of university-affiliated hospital networks in New York, USA (development and internal validation cohort [n = 183,711]) and Massachusetts, USA (validation cohort [n = 148,105]). We used stepwise backwards elimination to create ASRI. Results: The model showed discriminatory ability in the development, internal, and external validation cohorts with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.82 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.82 to 0.83), 0.82 (95% CI, 0.81 to 0.83), and 0.80 (95% CI, 0.79 to 0.80), respectively. In cases started in the afternoon, ASRI scores ≥ 43 had a total predicted risk for PACU stay past 8 p.m. of 32% (95% CI, 31.1 to 33.3) vs 8% (95% CI, 7.9 to 8.5) compared with low score values (P-for-interaction < 0.001), which translated to a higher direct PACU cost of care of USD 207 (95% CI, 194 to 2,019; model estimate, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.64 to 1.73; P < 0.001) The effects of using the ASRI score on PACU use efficiency were greater in a free-standing ASC with no limitations on PACU bed availability. Conclusion: We developed and validated a preoperative prediction tool for prolonged PACU-LOS after ambulatory surgery that can be used to guide scheduling in ambulatory surgery to optimize PACU use during normal work hours, particularly in settings without limitation of PACU bed availability. © 2023, Canadian Anesthesiologists' Society.},

	abstract = {Background: Hypotension is common in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) and intensive care unit (ICU), and is associated with adverse patient outcomes. The Hypotension Prediction Index (HPI) algorithm has been shown to accurately predict hypotension in mechanically ventilated patients in the OR and ICU and to reduce intraoperative hypotension (IOH). Since positive pressure ventilation significantly affects patient hemodynamics, we performed this validation study to examine the performance of the HPI algorithm in a non-ventilated PACU and ICU population. Materials & Methods: The performance of the HPI algorithm was assessed using prospectively collected blood pressure (BP) and HPI data from a PACU and a mixed ICU population. Recordings with sufficient time (≥3 h) spent without mechanical ventilation were selected using data from the electronic medical record. All HPI values were evaluated for sensitivity, specificity, predictive value, and time-to-event, and a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was constructed. Results: BP and HPI data from 282 patients were eligible for analysis, of which 242 (86%) were ICU patients. The mean age (standard deviation) was 63 (13.5) years, and 186 (66%) of the patients were male. Overall, the HPI predicted hypotension accurately, with an area under the ROC curve of 0.94. The most used HPI threshold cutoff in research and clinical use, 85, showed a sensitivity of 1.00, specificity of 0.79, median time-to-event of 160 s [60–380], PPV of 0.85, and NPV of 1.00. Conclusion: The absence of positive pressure ventilation and the influence thereof on patient hemodynamics does not negatively affect the performance of the HPI algorithm in predicting hypotension in the PACU and ICU. Future research should evaluate the feasibility and influence on hypotension and outcomes following HPI implementation in non-ventilated patients at risk of hypotension. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Days before surgery, add-ons may be scheduled to fill unused surgical block time at an outpatient surgery center. At times, outpatient surgery centers have time limitations for end of block time and discharge from the postanesthesia care unit (PACU). The objective of our study was to develop machine learning models that predicted the following composite outcome: (1) surgery finished by end of operating room block time and (2) patient was discharged by end of recovery room nursing shift. We compared various machine learning models to logistic regression. By evaluating various performance metrics, including F1 scores, we hypothesized that models using ensemble learning will be superior to logistic regression. METHODS: Data were collected from patients at an ambulatory surgery center. The primary outcome measurement was determined to have a value of 1 (versus 0) if they met both criteria: (1) surgery ends by 5 pm and (2) patient is discharged from the recovery room by 7 pm. We developed models to determine if a procedure would meet both criteria if it were scheduled at 1 pm, 2 pm, 3 pm, or 4 pm. We implemented regression, random forest, balanced random forest, balanced bagging, neural network, and support vector classifier, and included the following features: surgery, surgeon, service line, American Society of Anesthesiologists score, age, sex, weight, and scheduled case duration. We evaluated model performance with Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE). We compared the following performance metrics: F1 score, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), specificity, sensitivity, precision, recall, and Matthews correlation coefficient. RESULTS: Among 13,447 surgical procedures, the median total perioperative time (actual case duration and PACU length stay) was 165 minutes. When SMOTE was not used, when predicting whether surgery will end by 5 pm and patient will be discharged by 7 pm, the average F1 scores were best with random forest, balanced bagging, and balanced random forest classifiers. When SMOTE was used, these models had improved F1 scores compared to no SMOTE. The balanced bagging classifier performed best with F1 score of 0.78, 0.80, 0.82, and 0.82 when predicting our outcome if cases were to start at 1 pm, 2 pm, 3 pm, or 4 pm, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated improvement in predicting the outcome at a range of start times when using ensemble learning versus regression techniques. Machine learning may be adapted by operating room management to allow for a better determination whether an add-on case at an outpatient surgery center could be appropriately booked. © 2022 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

The incidents included the following disorders: delayed recovery, pain, bleeding, hypothermia, unplanned transfer to intensive care unit, shivering, agitation, nausea and vomiting, and respiratory or cardiovascular-related critical incidents. We then performed descriptive analyses and t test or χ2 test on the collected data. Findings: A total of 1,760 critical incidents were recorded in 1,417 patients among 92,136 patients. Most critical incidents were associated with the patients after general anesthesia and general or gynecologic surgery. The most common critical incidents noted in the present study were pain, followed by cardiovascular-related and respiratory-related incidents. The average length of stay in PACU was 61.50 ± 44.40 minutes for the patients with critical incidents and 28.50 ± 19.40 minutes for the patients without critical incidents.

PACUs require large nurse to patient ratios, which contributes to the cost of care. Despite the importance and cost of PACU length of stay (LOS), no standards have been established. We performed an observational study of 340 PACU patients to measure actual and medically appropriate PACU LOS (the time required to achieve a medically stable condition for safe PACU discharge), to identify factors related to LOS, and to create a LOS prediction index. Mean (± SD) actual LOS was 95 ± 43 min, and appropriate PACU LOS was 71 ± 37 min. Appropriate PACU LOS predictors were anesthetic time, anesthetic technique, and amount of intraoperative fluids. Actual LOS was >30 min longer than the medically appropriate LOS for 20% (68 of 340) of the patients. Frequent causes of excessive LOS were waiting for physician release or laboratory or radiographic results. Appropriate LOS may be related primarily to anesthetic factors, and nonmedical issues account for a significant amount of PACU LOS. Implications: Most patients are stabilized immediately after surgery in a postanesthesia care unit (PACU) until their discharge to a hospital ward. However, there are no standards for appropriate PACU length of stay (LOS). In this study, we measured actual and appropriate PACU LOSs and evaluated clinical factors that may influence PACU LOS.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The postanesthesia care unit (PACU) is an indispensable part of modern medicine which provides critical care to patients to ensure safe and smooth emergence from anesthesia. The adverse events in the PACU have been widely investigated in adults. However, little is known about the adverse events in pediatric populations. This study was designed to investigate adverse events, including the incidence, disease spectrum, and possible risk factors, in pediatric patients in the PACU at a tertiary pediatric hospital. Design: This is a retrospective observational study. Methods: Children admitted to the PACU at the Children's Hospital of Fudan University from September 2021 to August 2022 were included in the study. The following adverse events were recorded: hypothermia, fever, adverse airway events, hypotension, hypertension, prolonged length of stay in PACU, pain, reintubation, neurological events, unplanned admission to the intensive care unit, arrhythmia, water-electrolyte imbalance, and bleeding requiring medical intervention. Descriptive analyses, t tests, and χ2 tests were performed. Findings: A total of 16,012 children were included in the study, and 305 adverse events occurred in 237 (1.48%) children. The three most frequently occurring adverse events were prolonged stay in the PACU (8.4%), adverse airway events (5.6%), and abnormal temperature (2.7%). Age, American Society of Anesthesiologists' grade, and general surgery were independent risk factors of both overall adverse events and prolonged stay in the PACU in multivariate logistic regression analysis. Children with adverse events stayed in the PACU significantly longer than those without adverse events (60.04 ± 1.01 vs 95.8 ± 47.25 minutes, P < .05). Compared with the other surgeries, a significantly higher proportion of severe pain (37.5% vs 0%) after thoracic surgery, prolonged stay in the PACU (52.9% vs 36.4%) after general surgery, and neurological events (14.7% vs 0%) after neurological surgery was detected, while a significantly lower proportion of adverse airway events after general surgery (21.1% vs 43%) and neurological surgery (8.8% vs 43%) was detected, respectively. Conclusions: Our study reports the current incidence and spectrum of adverse events in the PACU at a tertiary pediatric hospital. Patients with young age, high American Society of Anesthesiologists' grade, and those from the general surgery department are at a significantly increased risk of adverse events in the PACU. Significant differences were detected in the proportion of specific adverse events after specific surgeries. © 2024 The American Society of PeriAnesthesia Nurses},

Less is known about the association between WC and acute perioperative adverse events. The purpose of the present investigation was to test the hypothesis that abdominal obesity increases the occurrence of perioperative adverse events in children undergoing elective, noncardiac surgeries. Design: Prospective observational study. Methods: We studied the association between WC and perioperative adverse events in children aged 6 to 18years who underwent elective noncardiac surgeries at our institution. Patients were considered to have abdominal obesity if WCwas 90th percentile or greater for age and gender. Subsequently, univariate factors associated with abdominal obesity were explored and then odds ratios for the occurrence of perioperative respiratory adverse events were calculated from logistic regression after controlling for clinically pertinent covariates. Results: Among 1,102 patients, the prevalence of abdominal obesity was 23.1%. WC was positively correlated with age and measured anthropometric parameters. Composite perioperative adverse events were more frequent in children with abdominal obesity. After adjusting for several clinically relevant risk factors, abdominal obesity independently predicted increased relative odds of respiratory adverse events (OR = 2.35, 95% CI = 1.6 to 3.5, P< .001). Abdominal obesity was also associated with prolonged postanesthesia care unit (PACU) length of stay. Conclusion: WC, a measure of abdominal obesity, is an independent predictor of perioperative respiratory adverse events in children undergoing elective noncardiac surgery. Furthermore, abdominal obesity was associated with prolonged PACU length of stay. © 2014.},

Methods Using a prospective observational design, we studied children aged 6-18 years undergoing elective non-cardiac surgeries at our institution. Trained research assistants collected clinical (including peri-operative adverse events) and anthropometric data on all individuals. Patients were stratified into two classes, habitual snorers and non-snorers. Subsequently, univariate factors associated with snoring were explored and then odds ratios for the occurrence of peri-operative adverse events were calculated from logistic regression after controlling for clinically relevant cofactors. Results Among 1102 patients, the prevalence of habitual snoring was 27.3% (28.2% for boys vs. 26.3% for girls). All the measured anthropometric parameters (BMI, waist circumference and neck circumference) were significantly higher in habitual snorers compared with non-snorers. The overall respiratory complication rate was 11.1%. Respiratory adverse events were more frequent in habitual snorers compared with non-snorers (16.9 vs. 8.9%; P<0.001). Additionally, habitual snoring was associated with longer postanaesthesia care unit (PACU) stay (114.0±49.6 vs. 103.6±48.9 min; P=0.002) even after controlling for the occurrence of adverse respiratory events. Conclusion The prevalence of habitual snoring was high in this cohort of paediatric surgical patients. Habitual snoring was associated with some peri-operative adverse events and prolonged PACU stay and should be considered an important symptom in the pre-operative review of children. © 2011 Copyright European Society of Anaesthesiology.},

Here, we compared postoperative adverse events in patients after brain tumor surgeries surveilled in a NCCU overnight or postanesthesia care unit (PACU) for a shorter duration.METHODS:We retrospectively studied 1070 consecutive patients who underwent craniotomy for brain tumor between 2016 and 2021. Inclusion criteria were age ≥18 years and craniotomy for resection or biopsy of intracerebral or extracerebral tumors. Cohorts were divided into 2 groups based on recovery destination, NCCU or PACU. Medical history, preoperative and postoperative neuroimaging, surgical resection features, diagnosis, and postoperative adverse events within 24 hours were reviewed for all patients.RESULTS:A total of 674 patients in the NCCU group and 396 patients in the PACU group were studied. The mean ages were 55.7 (NCCU) and 59.6 (PACU) years (P <.001). The American Society of Anesthesiologists class was not significantly different between groups (P =.42). The median recovery time was 19 hours (SD 24.5) for the NCCU group and 4 hours (SD 8) for the PACU group (P <.001). The incidence of adverse events within 24 hours postsurgery was 0.04 for the NCCU group and 0.028 for the PACU group (odds ratio 0.69, 95% CI 0.32-1.38, P =.40). The mean postoperative hospital stay was 9.6 days (SD 15.6) for the NCCU group and 8.5 days (SD 17.5) for the PACU group (P <.001).CONCLUSION:The incidence of adverse events within 24 hours after brain tumor surgery was not different between patients being surveilled for a long period in a NCCU or for a short period in a PACU.  © The Author(s) 2025.

This pilot study aimed to identify simple preoperative factors associated with postoperative adverse events. In 1291 surgical patients, the relationship between patient and surgical factors and adverse events in the post-anaesthesia care unit was examined using binomial logistic regression analysis. Adverse events in the postoperative care unit were common, including desaturation (13.6%), hypotension (5.8%) and apnoea (5.5%), with 19.9% of cases requiring attendance by an anaesthetist to manage unexpected complications. Average length-of-stay in the post-anaesthesia care unit was 120 minutes and prolonged stay for medical reasons was common. A number of patient and surgical factors, including surgical complexity, preoperative arrhythmia, previous anaesthetic issues and heart failure were strongly associated with these adverse events. Areas under receiver operating characteristic curves ranged from 0.63 to 0.80. Patients with adverse events in the post-anaesthesia care unit appeared to have a higher risk of intervention in postoperative wards from a medical emergency or intensive care unit team. Our preliminary findings suggest that preoperative identification of key factors may have utility in determining risk of early postoperative problems and hence, aid perioperative planning.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The efficiency and safety of American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) in predicting peri-bronchoscopic morbidity and mortality is an increasing concern as endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) gains popularity. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether the ASA classification is useful in risk stratification for EBUS. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The patients who underwent EBUS and had anesthesia assessment before the procedure, were enrolled. Data about the age, gender, comorbidity, ASA score, and complications were collected retrospectively from their medical files. RESULTS: A total of 221 patients with ASA class documentation in anesthesia assessment before EBUS, were enrolled in the study. The study population comprised 125 (56.6%) male and 96 (43.4%) female patients with a mean age of 59.08 ± 11.15 years. Comorbidity was present in 161 patients (72.9%), of which hypertension (64%) was the most common. There was no significant difference between the pre-bronchoscopic and post-bronchoscopic values of oxygen saturation (SpO2 ), systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and heart rate (respectively P = .83, P = .12, P = .15, P = .89). The most frequent complication during EBUS was desaturation that happened in 109 (49.3%) patients. There was no correlation between ASA score and complications (P > .999). There was no statistically significant difference in ASA scores with respect to complications (P = .14). The sensitivity and the specificity of pre-bronchoscopic evaluation in predicting the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU)/intensive care unit (ICU) requirement, were 83.3% and 61%, respectively. The significant deciding factors for post-bronchoscopic follow-up sites were found to be as ASA and age (respectively, P = .025, P < .001). CONCLUSION: There was no correlation between ASA and complications. To organize PACU/ICU beds more efficiently, a better scoring system is required. © 2021 by Turkish Thoracic Society.},

	abstract = {Objectives: Minimally invasive surgery for treatment of gynecologic malignancies is associated with decreased pain, fewer complications, earlier return to activity, lower cost, and shorter hospital stays. Patients are often discharged the day of surgery, but occasionally stay overnight due to prolonged post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) stays. The objective of this study was to identify risk factors for prolonged PACU length of stay (LOS). Methods: This is a single institution retrospective review of patients who underwent minimally invasive hysterectomy for gynecologic cancer from 2019 to 2022 and had a hospital stay <24-h. The primary outcome was PACU LOS. Demographics, pre-operative diagnoses, and surgical characteristics were recorded. After Box-Cox transformation, linear regression was used to determine significant predictors of PACU LOS. Results: For the 661 patients identified, median PACU LOS was 5.04 h (range 2.16–23.76 h). On univariate analysis, longer PACU LOS was associated with increased age (ρ = 0.106, p = 0.006), non-partnered status [mean difference (MD) = 0.019, p = 0.099], increased alcohol use (MD = 0.018, p = 0.102), increased Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) score (ρ = 0.065, p = 0.097), and ASA class ≥3 (MD = 0.033, p = 0.002). Using multivariate linear regression, increased age (R2 = 0.0011, p = 0.043), non-partnered status (R2 = 0.0389, p < 0.001), and ASA class ≥3 (R2 = 0.0250, p = 0.023) were associated with increased PACU LOS. Conclusions: Identifying patients at risk for prolonged PACU LOS, including patients who are older, non-partnered, and have an ASA class ≥3, may allow for interventions to improve patient experience, better utilize hospital resources, decrease PACU overcrowding, and limit postoperative admissions and complications. The relationship between non-partnered status and PACU LOS is the most novel relationship identified in this study. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Objective: This study aims to identify risk factors of hypoxemia in patients undergoin thoracoscopic lung surgery during their stay in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU). Hypoxemia was defined as any instance of SpO₂ ≤90% lasting for more than one minute during the PACU stay. Methods: We conducted a prospective research involving 398 patients who underwent elective thoracoscopic lung surgery in West China Hospital, Sichuan University, from April to July 2024. Patients were classified into hypoxemia and non-hypoxemia groups based on the presence of hypoxemia in the PACU. We compared clinical data between the two groups to identify factors influencing hypoxemia. Variables with statistical significance (P < 0.05) in univariate analysis were included in logistic regression to identify independent risk factors for hypoxemia. Results: Among the 398 patients studied, 149 (37.4%) experienced hypoxemia. Univariate analysis indicated significant differences in age, BMI, height, ASA classification, hypertension, diabetes, lung function test with Forced Expiratory Volume at 1 s / Forced Vital Capacity (FEV1/FVC), and awakening time between the groups. Logistic regression revealed that age, BMI, ASA classification, hypertension, diabetes, and awakening time were independent risk factors for hypoxemia during anesthesia recovery, while preoperative SpO2 upon entering operating room (OR = 0.882, 95% CI: 0.783–0.993, P = 0.038) was identified as a protective factor. Conclusion: Age, BMI, ASA classification, and preoperative conditions such as hypertension and diabetes are found to contribute to an increased incidence of hypoxemia in PACU following thoracoscopic lung surgery. Emphasizing preoperative lung function assessments and enhanced monitoring may also facilitate timely interventions, thereby improving post-anesthesia recovery and patient outcomes. © The Author(s) 2025.},

After PACU discharge, the electronic health record was reviewed for OSA risk stratification, PACU LOS, and unanticipated admissions. Findings: Forty-eight percent of patients screened were identified as intermediate or high risk. No difference existed between preimplementation and postimplementation PACU times (P =.767). No unanticipated admissions were identified during either period.

Methods: A total of 224 patients who entered the PACU from February 2018 to October 2018 after anesthesia surgery in our hospital were recruited as the research cohort. Among them, 46 had hypothermia and 178 did not. The patients' general and surgical data were recorded, and the risk factors for hypothermia in the PACU patients were analyzed using logistic regression. Another 68 hypothermia patients admitted to the PACU in our hospital were also recruited for this study. The patients in the routine group (RG) were insulated using quilts, while those in the observation group (OG) were insulated using inflatable warming blankets. The heat preservation effects of the two heat preservation methods on the PACU patients were compared. Results: Age >60 years old, an intraoperative infusion volume >1500 ml, an intraoperative blood loss >300 ml, major surgery, and an operation time >2 h were the risk factors for hypothermia in the PACU patients. The heat preservation times, the PACU retention times, and the patients' awake times in the OG were shorter than they were in the RG, and the incidence of complications related to hypothermia in the OG was lower than it was in the RG. In addition, the degree of satisfaction in the OG was higher than it was in the RG. Conclusion: Age >60 years old, an intraoperative infusion volume >1500 ml, an intraoperative blood loss >300 ml, major surgery, and an operation time >2 h are risk factors for hypothermia in PACU patients. Inflatable warming blankets have a better heat preservation effect and bring higher patient satisfaction than traditional quilts. © 2021 E-Century Publishing Corporation. All rights reserved.},

This retrospective analysis of our Centricity anesthesia database in 2017– 2019 assessed the efficiency of sugammadex in real-life situations in two groups of surgical cancer patients (breast and abdominal surgery) based on the extubation time, operating room exit time, and length of PACU stay. Overall, 382 anesthesia records (131 breast and 251 abdominal surgeries) were extracted for the pharmacological reversal of neuromuscular blockades by neostigmine or sugammadex. Sugammadex was used for reversal in 91 breast and 204 abdominal surgeries. Sugam-madex use did not affect the extubation time, operating room exit time, or length of PACU stay. However, the time to reach a 90% train of four (TOF) recovery was significantly faster in sugam-madex patients: 2 min (1.5–8) in breast surgery and 2 min (1.5–7) in abdominal surgery versus 10 (6–20) and 9 min (5–20), respectively, for neostigmine (p < 0.05). Most patients who were reversed with sugammadex (91%) reached a TOF ratio of at least 90%, while 54% of neostigmine patients had a 90% TOF ratio recorded (p < 0.05). Factors other than pharmacological reversal probably influence the extubation time, operating room exit time, or PACU stay; however, sugammadex reliably short-ened the time so as to reach a 90% TOF ratio with a better level of reversal. © 2021 by the authors.

Methods: Patients presenting for ambulatory surgery completed a self-administered questionnaire. Using a previously validated prediction model, the probability for OSA was determined. Patients with ≥ 70% propensities were considered to be at high risk of having the disorder. Relevant perioperative data and complications were tracked and recorded, and differences in median estimated propensities for OSA were considered by these data. Results: Three-thousand five hundred fifty-three patients completed the preoperative survey. A total of 2139 patients had perioperative data and estimated propensity scores. Ninety-four of the 2139 (4.4%) patients gave a self-reported prior diagnosis of OSA. One hundred three (4.8%) patients were found to be at high risk of OSA based on the survey and prediction model. Seventy-five percent of the patients with > 70% propensity for OSA had not yet been diagnosed. There was no association between OSA propensity scores and unplanned hospital admission, however there was an association of increased propensity with difficult intubation, intraoperative use of pressors, and postoperative oxygen saturation in the PACU. Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that undiagnosed OSA may be relatively common in an ambulatory surgical population. There was no relationship between unplanned hospital admission and diagnosis of or increased risk of OSA. However, there was an association of increased perioperative events requiring additional anesthetic management in patients with a diagnosis of, or with a higher propensity to OSA.},

	abstract = {Objective: Situational awareness and anticipatory guidance for nurses receiving a patient after surgery are keys to patient safety. Little work has defined the role of artificial intelligence (AI) to support these functions during nursing handoff communication or patient assessment. We used interviews to better understand how AI could work in this context. Materials and Methods: Eleven nurses participated in semistructured interviews. Mixed inductive-deductive thematic analysis was used to extract major themes and subthemes around roles for AI supporting postoperative nursing. Results: Five themes were generated from the interviews: (1) nurse understanding of patient condition guides care decisions, (2) handoffs are important to nurse situational awareness, but multiple barriers reduce their effectiveness, (3) AI may address barriers to handoff effectiveness, (4) AI may augment nurse care decision making and team communication outside of handoff, and (5) user experience in the electronic health record and information overload are likely barriers to using AI. Important subthemes included that AI-identified problems would be discussed at handoff and team communications, that AI-estimated elevated risks would trigger patient re-evaluation, and that AI-identified important data may be a valuable addition to nursing assessment. Discussion and Conclusion: Most research on postoperative handoff communication relies on structured checklists. Our results suggest that properly designed AI tools might facilitate postoperative handoff communication for nurses by identifying specific elevated risks faced by a patient, triggering discussion on those topics. Limitations include a single center, many participants lacking of applied experience with AI, and limited participation rate. © The Author(s) 2023.},

	abstract = {IMPORTANCE General-domain large language models may be able to perform risk stratification and predict postoperative outcome measures using a description of the procedure and a patient’s electronic health record notes. OBJECTIVE To examine predictive performance on 8 different tasks: prediction of American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status (ASA-PS), hospital admission, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, unplanned admission, hospital mortality, postanesthesia care unit (PACU) phase 1 duration, hospital duration, and ICU duration. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This prognostic study included task-specific datasets constructed from 2 years of retrospective electronic health records data collected during routine clinical care. Case and note data were formatted into prompts and given to the large language model GPT-4 Turbo (OpenAI) to generate a prediction and explanation. The setting included a quaternary care center comprising 3 academic hospitals and affiliated clinics in a single metropolitan area. Patients who had a surgery or procedure with anesthesia and at least 1 clinician-written note filed in the electronic health record before surgery were included in the study. Data were analyzed from November to December 2023. EXPOSURES Compared original notes, note summaries, few-shot prompting, and chain-of-thought prompting strategies. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES F1 score for binary and categorical outcomes. Mean absolute error for numerical duration outcomes. RESULTS Study results were measured on task-specific datasets, each with 1000 cases with the exception of unplanned admission, which had 949 cases, and hospital mortality, which had 576 cases. The best results for each task included an F1 score of 0.50 (95% CI, 0.47-0.53) for ASA-PS, 0.64 (95% CI, 0.61-0.67) for hospital admission, 0.81 (95% CI, 0.78-0.83) for ICU admission, 0.61 (95% CI, 0.58-0.64) for unplanned admission, and 0.86 (95% CI, 0.83-0.89) for hospital mortality prediction. Performance on duration prediction tasks was universally poor across all prompt strategies for which the large language model achieved a mean absolute error of 49 minutes (95% CI, 46-51 minutes) for PACU phase 1 duration, 4.5 days (95% CI, 4.2-5.0 days) for hospital duration, and 1.1 days (95% CI, 0.9-1.3 days) for ICU duration prediction. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Current general-domain large language models may assist clinicians in perioperative risk stratification on classification tasks but are inadequate for numerical duration predictions. Their ability to produce high-quality natural language explanations for the predictions may make them useful tools in clinical workflows and may be complementary to traditional risk prediction models. © 2024 American Medical Association.

Machine learning (ML) offers a novel approach to leveraging electronic health record (EHR) data for POD prediction. We sought to develop and internally validate a ML-derived POD risk prediction model using preoperative risk features, and to compare its performance to models developed with traditional logistic regression. Methods: This was a retrospective analysis of preoperative EHR data from 24,885 adults undergoing a procedure requiring anesthesia care, recovering in the main post-anesthesia care unit, and staying in the hospital at least overnight between December 2016 and December 2019 at either of two hospitals in a tertiary care health system. One hundred fifteen preoperative risk features including demographics, comorbidities, nursing assessments, surgery type, and other preoperative EHR data were used to predict postoperative delirium (POD), defined as any instance of Nursing Delirium Screening Scale ≥2 or positive Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit within the first 7 postoperative days. Two ML models (Neural Network and XGBoost), two traditional logistic regression models (“clinician-guided” and “ML hybrid”), and a previously described delirium risk stratification tool (AWOL-S) were evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC), sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio, and positive predictive value. Model calibration was assessed with a calibration curve. Patients with no POD assessments charted or at least 20% of input variables missing were excluded. Results: POD incidence was 5.3%. The AUC-ROC for Neural Net was 0.841 [95% CI 0. 816–0.863] and for XGBoost was 0.851 [95% CI 0.827–0.874], which was significantly better than the clinician-guided (AUC-ROC 0.763 [0.734–0.793], p < 0.001) and ML hybrid (AUC-ROC 0.824 [0.800–0.849], p < 0.001) regression models and AWOL-S (AUC-ROC 0.762 [95% CI 0.713–0.812], p < 0.001). Neural Net, XGBoost, and ML hybrid models demonstrated excellent calibration, while calibration of the clinician-guided and AWOL-S models was moderate; they tended to overestimate delirium risk in those already at highest risk. Conclusion: Using pragmatically collected EHR data, two ML models predicted POD in a broad perioperative population with high discrimination. Optimal application of the models would provide automated, real-time delirium risk stratification to improve perioperative management of surgical patients at risk for POD. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Residual neuromuscular block (rNMB) after surgery is not difficult to identify if proper neuromuscular monitoring is used, but many clinicians do not use quantitative neuromuscular monitoring. OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to develop a REsidual neuromuscular block Prediction Score (REPS) to predict postoperative rNMB and compare the predictive accuracy of the prediction score with train-of-four count (TOFC) measurement at the end of a surgical case. DESIGN Retrospective cohort study of data on file. DATA SOURCE Electronic patient data and peri-operative data on vital signs, administered medications, and train-of-four ratio (TOFR) obtained in the postoperative recovery rooms [postanaesthesia care unit (PACU)] at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts, USA. PATIENTS Quantitative TOFR measurements obtained on admission to the PACU were available from 2144 adult noncardiac surgical patients. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Presence of rNMB at PACU admission, defined as a TOFR of less than 0.9. RESULTS In the score development cohort (n¼2144), rNMB occurred in 432 cases (20.2%). Ten independent predictors for residual paralysis were identified and used for the score development. The final model included: hepatic failure, neurological disease, high-neostigmine dose, metastatic tumour, female sex, short time between neuromuscular blocking agent administration and extubation, aminosteroidal neuromuscular blocking agent, BMI more than 35, absence of nurse anaesthetist and having an experienced surgeon. The model discrimination by C statistics was 0.63, 95% confidence interval (0.60 to 0.66), and risk categories derived from the REPS had a higher accuracy than the last documented intra-operative TOFC for predicting rNMB (net reclassification improvement score 0.26, standard error 0.03, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION The REPS can be used to identify patients at greater risk of rNMB. This tool may inform anaesthetists better than an intra-operative TOFC and thus enable perioperative anaesthetic practices to be tailored to the patient and minimise the undesirable effects of rNMB. © 2018 European Society of Anaesthesiology.

	abstract = {Objective: We test the hypothesis that for low-acuity surgical patients, postoperative intensive care unit (ICU) admission is associated with lower value of care compared with ward admission. Background: Overtriaging low-acuity patients to ICU consumes valuable resources and may not confer better patient outcomes. Associations among postoperative overtriage, patient outcomes, costs, and value of care have not been previously reported. Methods: In this longitudinal cohort study, postoperative ICU admissions were classified as overtriaged or appropriately triaged according to machine learning-based patient acuity assessments and requirements for immediate postoperative mechanical ventilation or vasopressor support. The nearest neighbors algorithm identified risk-matched control ward admissions. The primary outcome was value of care, calculated as inverse observed-to-expected mortality ratios divided by total costs. Results: Acuity assessments had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.92 in generating predictions for triage classifications. Of 8592 postoperative ICU admissions, 423 (4.9%) were overtriaged. These were matched with 2155 control ward admissions with similar comorbidities, incidence of emergent surgery, immediate postoperative vital signs, and do not resuscitate order placement and rescindment patterns. Compared with controls, overtraiged admissions did not have a lower incidence of any measured complications. Total costs for admission were $16.4K for overtriage and $15.9K for controls (P=0.03). Value of care was lower for overtriaged admissions [2.9 (2.0-4.0)] compared with controls [24.2 (14.1-34.5), P<0.001]. Conclusions: Low-acuity postoperative patients who were overtriaged to ICUs had increased total costs, no improvements in outcomes, and received low-value care. © 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

	abstract = {Background: Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is a key driver of unplanned admission and patient satisfaction after surgery. Because traditional risk factors do not completely explain variability in risk, this study hypothesized that genetics may contribute to the overall risk for this complication. The objective of this research is to perform a genome-wide association study of PONV, derive a polygenic risk score for PONV, assess associations between the risk score and PONV in a validation cohort, and compare any genetic contributions to known clinical risks for PONV. Methods: Surgeries with integrated genetic and perioperative data performed under general anesthesia at Michigan Medicine (Ann Arbor, Michigan) and Vanderbilt University Medical Center (Nashville, Tennessee) were studied. PONV was defined as nausea or emesis occurring and documented in the postanesthesia care unit. In the discovery phase, genome-wide association studies were performed on each genetic cohort, and the results were meta-analyzed. Next, the polygenic phase assessed whether a polygenic score, derived from genome-wide association study in a derivation cohort from Vanderbilt University Medical Center, improved prediction within a validation cohort from Michigan Medicine, as quantified by discrimination (c-statistic) and net reclassification index. Results: Of 64,523 total patients, 5,703 developed PONV (8.8%). The study identified 46 genetic variants exceeding the threshold of P < 1 × 10-5, occurring with minor allele frequency greater than 1%, and demonstrating concordant effects in both cohorts. Standardized polygenic score was associated with PONV in a basic model, controlling for age and sex (adjusted odds ratio, 1.027 per SD increase in overall genetic risk; 95% CI, 1.001 to 1.053; P = 0.044), a model based on known clinical risks (adjusted odds ratio, 1.029; 95% CI, 1.003 to 1.055; P = 0.030), and a full clinical regression, controlling for 21 demographic, surgical, and anesthetic factors, (adjusted odds ratio, 1.029; 95% CI, 1.002 to 1.056; P = 0.033). The addition of polygenic score improved overall discrimination in models based on known clinical risk factors (c-statistic, 0.616 compared to 0.613; P = 0.028) and improved net reclassification of 4.6% of cases. Conclusions: Standardized polygenic risk was associated with PONV in all three of the study's models, but the genetic influence was smaller than exerted by clinical risk factors. Specifically, a patient with a polygenic risk score greater than 1 SD above the mean has 2 to 3% greater odds of developing PONV when compared to the baseline population, which is at least an order of magnitude smaller than the increase associated with having prior PONV or motion sickness (55%), having a history of migraines (17%), or being female (83%) and is not clinically significant. Furthermore, the use of a polygenic risk score does not meaningfully improve discrimination compared to clinical risk factors and is not clinically useful.  Copyright © 2024 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Background: The contemporary healthcare environment is complex with mounting pressures to perform greater procedural volumes with less support staff to minimize costs and maximize efficiency. This report details an analysis of routine endovascular procedures performed with dedicated vascular support staff during daytime hours compared to similar cases performed after hours with general operating room staff. Methods: All lower extremity endovascular cases over a 37-month period were identified using Current Procedural Terminology codes from a query of our institutional database. Emergent/urgent cases and cases with associated open surgical procedures were excluded. Cases were divided according to the time of day and available clinical support structure according to procedure start time: specialty-specific daytime (SS) and general staff after hours for all others (AH). The resulting case list was examined by case type according to SS or AH designation and case types occurring disproportionately during either time frame were excluded to create a homogenous group of cases. Demographics, case specifics, and cost data were then obtained from the electronic health record and our enterprise cost data warehouse. Multivariable mixed linear modeling was used to examine component costs (i.e., anesthesia, supplies, etc.) and total costs controlling for a number of factors that could affect cost. Results: Two hundred fifty-two routine endovascular-only procedures were examined in 232 patients (190 SS, 42 AH). No significant differences in procedure specifics were observed between the groups [number and location of access site(s), indication for procedure, type and number of interventions, etc.]. Multivariable analyses controlled for factors affecting costs. Costs associated with anesthesia (cost ratio 1.90, P = 0.001), operating room time costs (cost ratio 1.29, P = 0.03), and post anesthesia recovery (cost ratio 1.23, P = 0.004) were all significantly increased in AH cases compared to SS cases. The average total hospital cost for routine endovascular cases that performed AH was $8,095 compared to $5,636 for SS cases (cost ratio 1.44, P = 0.008). Conclusions: Performance of routine endovascular cases was associated with significantly less cost to the hospital system when performed by SS teams during regular hospital hours with a ∼30% increase in total cost associated with AH cases. In the current healthcare environment, investments in SS teams and process improvements are likely to be cost effective. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.},
