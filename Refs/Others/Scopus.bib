	abstract = {Study Objectives: The aims of this study were to: (a) assess the prevalence of diagnosed OSA and symptoms of undiagnosed OSA in a cohort of ambulatory surgical patients, and (b) characterize the frequency of postoperative complications in outpatients with a diagnosis of or a propensity to OSA. Methods: Patients presenting for ambulatory surgery completed a self-administered questionnaire. Using a previously validated prediction model, the probability for OSA was determined. Patients with ≥ 70% propensities were considered to be at high risk of having the disorder. Relevant perioperative data and complications were tracked and recorded, and differences in median estimated propensities for OSA were considered by these data. Results: Three-thousand five hundred fifty-three patients completed the preoperative survey. A total of 2139 patients had perioperative data and estimated propensity scores. Ninety-four of the 2139 (4.4%) patients gave a self-reported prior diagnosis of OSA. One hundred three (4.8%) patients were found to be at high risk of OSA based on the survey and prediction model. Seventy-five percent of the patients with > 70% propensity for OSA had not yet been diagnosed. There was no association between OSA propensity scores and unplanned hospital admission, however there was an association of increased propensity with difficult intubation, intraoperative use of pressors, and postoperative oxygen saturation in the PACU. Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that undiagnosed OSA may be relatively common in an ambulatory surgical population. There was no relationship between unplanned hospital admission and diagnosis of or increased risk of OSA. However, there was an association of increased perioperative events requiring additional anesthetic management in patients with a diagnosis of, or with a higher propensity to OSA.},

	abstract = {Objective: Situational awareness and anticipatory guidance for nurses receiving a patient after surgery are keys to patient safety. Little work has defined the role of artificial intelligence (AI) to support these functions during nursing handoff communication or patient assessment. We used interviews to better understand how AI could work in this context. Materials and Methods: Eleven nurses participated in semistructured interviews. Mixed inductive-deductive thematic analysis was used to extract major themes and subthemes around roles for AI supporting postoperative nursing. Results: Five themes were generated from the interviews: (1) nurse understanding of patient condition guides care decisions, (2) handoffs are important to nurse situational awareness, but multiple barriers reduce their effectiveness, (3) AI may address barriers to handoff effectiveness, (4) AI may augment nurse care decision making and team communication outside of handoff, and (5) user experience in the electronic health record and information overload are likely barriers to using AI. Important subthemes included that AI-identified problems would be discussed at handoff and team communications, that AI-estimated elevated risks would trigger patient re-evaluation, and that AI-identified important data may be a valuable addition to nursing assessment. Discussion and Conclusion: Most research on postoperative handoff communication relies on structured checklists. Our results suggest that properly designed AI tools might facilitate postoperative handoff communication for nurses by identifying specific elevated risks faced by a patient, triggering discussion on those topics. Limitations include a single center, many participants lacking of applied experience with AI, and limited participation rate. © The Author(s) 2023.},

	abstract = {IMPORTANCE General-domain large language models may be able to perform risk stratification and predict postoperative outcome measures using a description of the procedure and a patient’s electronic health record notes. OBJECTIVE To examine predictive performance on 8 different tasks: prediction of American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status (ASA-PS), hospital admission, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, unplanned admission, hospital mortality, postanesthesia care unit (PACU) phase 1 duration, hospital duration, and ICU duration. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This prognostic study included task-specific datasets constructed from 2 years of retrospective electronic health records data collected during routine clinical care. Case and note data were formatted into prompts and given to the large language model GPT-4 Turbo (OpenAI) to generate a prediction and explanation. The setting included a quaternary care center comprising 3 academic hospitals and affiliated clinics in a single metropolitan area. Patients who had a surgery or procedure with anesthesia and at least 1 clinician-written note filed in the electronic health record before surgery were included in the study. Data were analyzed from November to December 2023. EXPOSURES Compared original notes, note summaries, few-shot prompting, and chain-of-thought prompting strategies. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES F1 score for binary and categorical outcomes. Mean absolute error for numerical duration outcomes. RESULTS Study results were measured on task-specific datasets, each with 1000 cases with the exception of unplanned admission, which had 949 cases, and hospital mortality, which had 576 cases. The best results for each task included an F1 score of 0.50 (95% CI, 0.47-0.53) for ASA-PS, 0.64 (95% CI, 0.61-0.67) for hospital admission, 0.81 (95% CI, 0.78-0.83) for ICU admission, 0.61 (95% CI, 0.58-0.64) for unplanned admission, and 0.86 (95% CI, 0.83-0.89) for hospital mortality prediction. Performance on duration prediction tasks was universally poor across all prompt strategies for which the large language model achieved a mean absolute error of 49 minutes (95% CI, 46-51 minutes) for PACU phase 1 duration, 4.5 days (95% CI, 4.2-5.0 days) for hospital duration, and 1.1 days (95% CI, 0.9-1.3 days) for ICU duration prediction. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Current general-domain large language models may assist clinicians in perioperative risk stratification on classification tasks but are inadequate for numerical duration predictions. Their ability to produce high-quality natural language explanations for the predictions may make them useful tools in clinical workflows and may be complementary to traditional risk prediction models. © 2024 American Medical Association.

	abstract = {Background: Accurate, pragmatic risk stratification for postoperative delirium (POD) is necessary to target preventative resources toward high-risk patients. Machine learning (ML) offers a novel approach to leveraging electronic health record (EHR) data for POD prediction. We sought to develop and internally validate a ML-derived POD risk prediction model using preoperative risk features, and to compare its performance to models developed with traditional logistic regression. Methods: This was a retrospective analysis of preoperative EHR data from 24,885 adults undergoing a procedure requiring anesthesia care, recovering in the main post-anesthesia care unit, and staying in the hospital at least overnight between December 2016 and December 2019 at either of two hospitals in a tertiary care health system. One hundred fifteen preoperative risk features including demographics, comorbidities, nursing assessments, surgery type, and other preoperative EHR data were used to predict postoperative delirium (POD), defined as any instance of Nursing Delirium Screening Scale ≥2 or positive Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit within the first 7 postoperative days. Two ML models (Neural Network and XGBoost), two traditional logistic regression models (“clinician-guided” and “ML hybrid”), and a previously described delirium risk stratification tool (AWOL-S) were evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC), sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio, and positive predictive value. Model calibration was assessed with a calibration curve. Patients with no POD assessments charted or at least 20% of input variables missing were excluded. Results: POD incidence was 5.3%. The AUC-ROC for Neural Net was 0.841 [95% CI 0. 816–0.863] and for XGBoost was 0.851 [95% CI 0.827–0.874], which was significantly better than the clinician-guided (AUC-ROC 0.763 [0.734–0.793], p < 0.001) and ML hybrid (AUC-ROC 0.824 [0.800–0.849], p < 0.001) regression models and AWOL-S (AUC-ROC 0.762 [95% CI 0.713–0.812], p < 0.001). Neural Net, XGBoost, and ML hybrid models demonstrated excellent calibration, while calibration of the clinician-guided and AWOL-S models was moderate; they tended to overestimate delirium risk in those already at highest risk. Conclusion: Using pragmatically collected EHR data, two ML models predicted POD in a broad perioperative population with high discrimination. Optimal application of the models would provide automated, real-time delirium risk stratification to improve perioperative management of surgical patients at risk for POD. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Residual neuromuscular block (rNMB) after surgery is not difficult to identify if proper neuromuscular monitoring is used, but many clinicians do not use quantitative neuromuscular monitoring. OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to develop a REsidual neuromuscular block Prediction Score (REPS) to predict postoperative rNMB and compare the predictive accuracy of the prediction score with train-of-four count (TOFC) measurement at the end of a surgical case. DESIGN Retrospective cohort study of data on file. DATA SOURCE Electronic patient data and peri-operative data on vital signs, administered medications, and train-of-four ratio (TOFR) obtained in the postoperative recovery rooms [postanaesthesia care unit (PACU)] at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts, USA. PATIENTS Quantitative TOFR measurements obtained on admission to the PACU were available from 2144 adult noncardiac surgical patients. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Presence of rNMB at PACU admission, defined as a TOFR of less than 0.9. RESULTS In the score development cohort (n¼2144), rNMB occurred in 432 cases (20.2%). Ten independent predictors for residual paralysis were identified and used for the score development. The final model included: hepatic failure, neurological disease, high-neostigmine dose, metastatic tumour, female sex, short time between neuromuscular blocking agent administration and extubation, aminosteroidal neuromuscular blocking agent, BMI more than 35, absence of nurse anaesthetist and having an experienced surgeon. The model discrimination by C statistics was 0.63, 95% confidence interval (0.60 to 0.66), and risk categories derived from the REPS had a higher accuracy than the last documented intra-operative TOFC for predicting rNMB (net reclassification improvement score 0.26, standard error 0.03, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION The REPS can be used to identify patients at greater risk of rNMB. This tool may inform anaesthetists better than an intra-operative TOFC and thus enable perioperative anaesthetic practices to be tailored to the patient and minimise the undesirable effects of rNMB. © 2018 European Society of Anaesthesiology.

	abstract = {Background: The contemporary healthcare environment is complex with mounting pressures to perform greater procedural volumes with less support staff to minimize costs and maximize efficiency. This report details an analysis of routine endovascular procedures performed with dedicated vascular support staff during daytime hours compared to similar cases performed after hours with general operating room staff. Methods: All lower extremity endovascular cases over a 37-month period were identified using Current Procedural Terminology codes from a query of our institutional database. Emergent/urgent cases and cases with associated open surgical procedures were excluded. Cases were divided according to the time of day and available clinical support structure according to procedure start time: specialty-specific daytime (SS) and general staff after hours for all others (AH). The resulting case list was examined by case type according to SS or AH designation and case types occurring disproportionately during either time frame were excluded to create a homogenous group of cases. Demographics, case specifics, and cost data were then obtained from the electronic health record and our enterprise cost data warehouse. Multivariable mixed linear modeling was used to examine component costs (i.e., anesthesia, supplies, etc.) and total costs controlling for a number of factors that could affect cost. Results: Two hundred fifty-two routine endovascular-only procedures were examined in 232 patients (190 SS, 42 AH). No significant differences in procedure specifics were observed between the groups [number and location of access site(s), indication for procedure, type and number of interventions, etc.]. Multivariable analyses controlled for factors affecting costs. Costs associated with anesthesia (cost ratio 1.90, P = 0.001), operating room time costs (cost ratio 1.29, P = 0.03), and post anesthesia recovery (cost ratio 1.23, P = 0.004) were all significantly increased in AH cases compared to SS cases. The average total hospital cost for routine endovascular cases that performed AH was $8,095 compared to $5,636 for SS cases (cost ratio 1.44, P = 0.008). Conclusions: Performance of routine endovascular cases was associated with significantly less cost to the hospital system when performed by SS teams during regular hospital hours with a ∼30% increase in total cost associated with AH cases. In the current healthcare environment, investments in SS teams and process improvements are likely to be cost effective. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Objective: We test the hypothesis that for low-acuity surgical patients, postoperative intensive care unit (ICU) admission is associated with lower value of care compared with ward admission. Background: Overtriaging low-acuity patients to ICU consumes valuable resources and may not confer better patient outcomes. Associations among postoperative overtriage, patient outcomes, costs, and value of care have not been previously reported. Methods: In this longitudinal cohort study, postoperative ICU admissions were classified as overtriaged or appropriately triaged according to machine learning-based patient acuity assessments and requirements for immediate postoperative mechanical ventilation or vasopressor support. The nearest neighbors algorithm identified risk-matched control ward admissions. The primary outcome was value of care, calculated as inverse observed-to-expected mortality ratios divided by total costs. Results: Acuity assessments had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.92 in generating predictions for triage classifications. Of 8592 postoperative ICU admissions, 423 (4.9%) were overtriaged. These were matched with 2155 control ward admissions with similar comorbidities, incidence of emergent surgery, immediate postoperative vital signs, and do not resuscitate order placement and rescindment patterns. Compared with controls, overtraiged admissions did not have a lower incidence of any measured complications. Total costs for admission were $16.4K for overtriage and $15.9K for controls (P=0.03). Value of care was lower for overtriaged admissions [2.9 (2.0-4.0)] compared with controls [24.2 (14.1-34.5), P<0.001]. Conclusions: Low-acuity postoperative patients who were overtriaged to ICUs had increased total costs, no improvements in outcomes, and received low-value care. © 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

	abstract = {Background: Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is a key driver of unplanned admission and patient satisfaction after surgery. Because traditional risk factors do not completely explain variability in risk, this study hypothesized that genetics may contribute to the overall risk for this complication. The objective of this research is to perform a genome-wide association study of PONV, derive a polygenic risk score for PONV, assess associations between the risk score and PONV in a validation cohort, and compare any genetic contributions to known clinical risks for PONV. Methods: Surgeries with integrated genetic and perioperative data performed under general anesthesia at Michigan Medicine (Ann Arbor, Michigan) and Vanderbilt University Medical Center (Nashville, Tennessee) were studied. PONV was defined as nausea or emesis occurring and documented in the postanesthesia care unit. In the discovery phase, genome-wide association studies were performed on each genetic cohort, and the results were meta-analyzed. Next, the polygenic phase assessed whether a polygenic score, derived from genome-wide association study in a derivation cohort from Vanderbilt University Medical Center, improved prediction within a validation cohort from Michigan Medicine, as quantified by discrimination (c-statistic) and net reclassification index. Results: Of 64,523 total patients, 5,703 developed PONV (8.8%). The study identified 46 genetic variants exceeding the threshold of P < 1 × 10-5, occurring with minor allele frequency greater than 1%, and demonstrating concordant effects in both cohorts. Standardized polygenic score was associated with PONV in a basic model, controlling for age and sex (adjusted odds ratio, 1.027 per SD increase in overall genetic risk; 95% CI, 1.001 to 1.053; P = 0.044), a model based on known clinical risks (adjusted odds ratio, 1.029; 95% CI, 1.003 to 1.055; P = 0.030), and a full clinical regression, controlling for 21 demographic, surgical, and anesthetic factors, (adjusted odds ratio, 1.029; 95% CI, 1.002 to 1.056; P = 0.033). The addition of polygenic score improved overall discrimination in models based on known clinical risk factors (c-statistic, 0.616 compared to 0.613; P = 0.028) and improved net reclassification of 4.6% of cases. Conclusions: Standardized polygenic risk was associated with PONV in all three of the study's models, but the genetic influence was smaller than exerted by clinical risk factors. Specifically, a patient with a polygenic risk score greater than 1 SD above the mean has 2 to 3% greater odds of developing PONV when compared to the baseline population, which is at least an order of magnitude smaller than the increase associated with having prior PONV or motion sickness (55%), having a history of migraines (17%), or being female (83%) and is not clinically significant. Furthermore, the use of a polygenic risk score does not meaningfully improve discrimination compared to clinical risk factors and is not clinically useful.  Copyright © 2024 The Author(s).
