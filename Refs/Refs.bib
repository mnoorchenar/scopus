	abstract = {Sequence modeling is a critical yet challenging task with wide-ranging applications, especially in time series forecasting for domains like weather prediction, temperature monitoring, and energy load forecasting. Transformers, with their attention mechanism, have emerged as state-of-the-art due to their efficient parallel training, but they suffer from quadratic time complexity, limiting their scalability for long sequences. In contrast, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) offer linear time complexity, spurring renewed interest in linear RNNs for more computationally efficient sequence modeling. In this work, we introduce BLUR (Bidirectional Linear Unit for Recurrent network), which uses forward and backward linear recurrent units (LRUs) to capture both past and future dependencies with high computational efficiency. BLUR maintains the linear time complexity of traditional RNNs, while enabling fast parallel training through LRUs. Furthermore, it offers provably stable training and strong approximation capabilities, making it highly effective for modeling long-term dependencies. Extensive experiments on sequential image and time series datasets reveal that BLUR not only surpasses transformers and traditional RNNs in accuracy but also significantly reduces computational costs, making it particularly suitable for real-world forecasting tasks.

	abstract = {Accurate power load forecasting in industrial parks is crucial for optimizing energy management and operational efficiency. Existing models struggle with industrial load series’ complex, multi-target nature and the need to integrate diverse exogenous variables. This paper introduces the Temporal Structure-Preserving Transformer (TSPT), a novel architecture that addresses these challenges by decomposing multi-target series into univariate series, enabling parallel processing and integrating exogenous data. The TSPT model incorporates the Gated Feature Fusion (GFF), which learns to capture multiscale temporal patterns from each target sequence and exogenous factors by preserving the temporal structure of the series. This parallel processing and the structure-preserving transformations allow TSPT to effectively integrate domain-specific knowledge, such as weather, production, and efficiency data, enhancing its forecasting performance. Comprehensive experiments on a real-world industrial park dataset demonstrate TSPT's superiority over state-of-the-art methods in handling complex, multi-target forecasting tasks with integrated exogenous variables. The proposed approach offers a pathway for scalable and accurate load forecasting in industrial settings, improving energy management and operational decision-making. © 2025 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Modern energy management systems must include load forecasting in order for utilities to plan and optimize electricity distribution, lower operating costs, and improve grid stability. With the addition of renewable energy sources and the advancement of smart grid technology, energy systems have become increasingly complex, making accurate forecasting increasingly challenging. Conventional techniques, including regression models and ARIMA, frequently perform less well because they are unable to capture the complex multivariate relationships and temporal dependencies present in energy data. Furthermore, these techniques are prone to errors in the presence of noisy data and have scalability issues when used on big, high-dimensional datasets. This paper presents a hybrid forecasting framework that combines artificial neural networks with Time Series Transformers and Fuzzy Logic Transform in order to overcome these drawbacks. The Transformer architecture excels in capturing long-term dependencies and interdependencies between features through its self-attention mechanism. Meanwhile, FLT + ANN effectively preprocesses noisy, irregular data and models short-term nonlinear patterns. The combination of these techniques creates a robust framework capable of handling complex energy datasets while maintaining high accuracy. Extensive tests on actual energy datasets show that the suggested hybrid model outperforms both conventional and stand-alone methods. With RMSE and MAE reductions of up to 15–20%, the model outperforms baseline models such as Random Forests, Decision Trees, and Linear Regression. These findings demonstrate how the suggested paradigm has the potential to transform load forecasting and enable more intelligent, effective energy systems. © The Author(s) 2025.},

	abstract = {Accurate power load forecasting plays a pivotal role in ensuring operational safety, grid stability, and cost-effective energy dispatch. However, current research paradigms predominantly concentrate on temporal pattern mining of historical load datasets, while inadequately addressing the synergistic effects arising from multidimensional external drivers such as meteorological variations and socio-temporal cycles (e.g., holiday-induced demand fluctuations). Furthermore, existing methods are challenged in effectively handling the inherent non-stationarity and multi-scale periodic characteristics of power loads. To overcome these challenges, the study proposes a gated feature fusion framework designed to enhance power load prediction accuracy. This innovative framework integrates two key components: an adaptive signal decomposition module and a cross-scale temporal gating module. Collectively, these components enable effective learning of complex interdependencies among multiple features, including load characteristics. First, an adaptive signal decomposition module was developed through synergistic integration of Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) and a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. Fine modal separation of power load sequences by PSO-coordinated optimisation of VMD parameters.Secondly, a novel parallel gated feature fusion architecture was developed, which strategically integrates the local temporal feature extraction capability of Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) with the global dependency modeling advantage of Transformer Decoder. The fusion weights of features of different temporal scales are dynamically adjusted through the introduction of an adaptive weight allocation mechanism, thus realising the optimal extraction and fusion of multi-scale temporal features. At last, the proposed method was applied to the Belgian power load dataset, where both short-term and long-term dependencies within the load data were effectively mined, demonstrating higher forecasting accuracy. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Accurate long-term electric load forecasting—multi-year, day-ahead peak-load prediction—is critical for planning, operations, and policy. While traditional statistical and shallow machine-learning methods often struggle with nonlinear and multi-scale temporal patterns, deep learning offers promising alternatives. This study conducts a systematic, controlled comparison of three architectures—Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)—within a unified Bayesian hyperparameter optimization protocol using daily peak-load data from the New South Wales (NSW) electricity market, 2015–2021, with a 365-day look-back window. Under identical data splits, objective, and search procedures, CNN delivers the best accuracy across all metrics (MAE = 699, MSE = 791,838, RMSE = 890, MAPE = 7.53%), MLP performs slightly worse, and LSTM yields the most significant errors alongside the most extended runtime. These results indicate that, under consistent tuning and a one-year context window, CNN captures local variations more effectively than the recurrent alternative in this setting. The research contribution of this study is a fair, empirical benchmark of widely used deep models (MLP, CNN, LSTM) for multi-year, day-ahead peak-load forecasting under a single Bayesian optimization framework, offering practical guidance for model selection. Reproducibility is facilitated by fixed random seeds and comprehensive configuration/trace logging. Limitations include an intentionally univariate design (no exogenous variables), a focus on learned architectures rather than naïve baselines, and the absence of uncertainty quantification; future work will extend to multivariate inputs (e.g., weather and calendar effects), hybrid CNN–LSTM and Transformer-based models, and broader baseline and robustness evaluations. © 2025, Universitas Ahmad Dahlan.

This method employs a multi-head spatio-temporal attention module to model long-term dependencies in the time dimension and nonlinear interactions in the feature dimension in parallel across multiple subspaces. Additionally, a dynamic adaptive graph convolution module is designed to construct adaptive adjacency matrices by combining physical topology and feature similarity, dynamically adjusting node connection weights based on real-time load characteristics to more accurately characterize the spatial dynamics of multi-energy interactions. Furthermore, TSTG adopts an end-to-end spatio-temporal joint optimization framework, achieving synchronous extraction and fusion of spatio-temporal features through an encoder–decoder architecture. Experimental results show that TSTG significantly outperforms existing methods in short-term load forecasting tasks, providing an effective solution for refined forecasting in integrated energy systems. © 2025 by the authors.},

	abstract = {In this study, we consider monthly load forecasting, which is an essential decision for energy infrastructure planning and investment. This study focuses on the Texas power grid, where electricity consumption has surged due to rising industrial activity and the increased construction of data centers driven by growing demand for AI. Based on an extensive exploratory data analysis, we identify key characteristics of monthly electricity demand in Texas, including an accelerating upward trend, strong seasonality, and temperature sensitivity. In response, we propose a regression-based forecasting model that incorporates a carefully designed set of input features, including a nonlinear trend, lagged demand variables, a seasonality-adjusted month variable, average temperature of a representative area, and calendar-based proxies for industrial activity. We adopt a rolling forecasting approach, generating 12-month-ahead forecasts for both 2023 and 2024 using monthly data from 2013 onward. Comparative experiments against benchmarks including Holt–Winters, SARIMA, Prophet, RNN, LSTM, Transformer, Random Forest, LightGBM, and XGBoost show that the proposed model achieves superior performance with a mean absolute percentage error of approximately 2%. The results indicate that a well-designed regression approach can effectively outperform even the latest machine learning methods in monthly load forecasting. © 2025 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Electrical load forecasting is essential for the efficient operation and planning of power systems. Recent studies have employed Transformer models in forecasting due to their unique attention mechanisms and ability to extract correlations in data. However, these models face challenges in integrating varied data types and capturing long-term dependencies. To address these limitations, this study proposes a TFTformer, a transformer-based neural network designed to enhance the accuracy and generalisability of load forecasting models. The TFTformer incorporates transposed feature-specific embeddings for weather, time, and load data to more accurately capture their unique characteristics. A linear transformation layer post embedding improves feature representation, aligning and standardising features across sequences for improved pattern recognition. Additionally, a Temporal Convolutional Network is integrated within the Transformer's encoder, employing causal convolutions and dilation to adapt to the sequential nature of data with an expanded receptive field. The effectiveness of the TFTformer is demonstrated through a comparative study against several state-of-the-art methods using load datasets from Belgium, New Zealand, and five Australian states. The results demonstrate that the TFTformer achieves significant MSE improvements across different locations, with over 50% improvement over most models, 42% over CARD, and 16%–17% improvement compared to iFlowformer and iReformer. Furthermore, an Analysis of Variance is conducted to evaluate the impact of each component of the TFTformer. A SHAP-based interpretability analysis, using surrogate models, is conducted to elucidate the decision-making process of TFTformer, highlighting the critical role of time factors and weather features in its predictions. © 2025 The Author(s)},

This study proposes a novel Complete Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition with Adaptive Noise-Fast Fourier Transform-inverted Transformer-Long Short-Term Memory (CEEMDAN-FFT-iTransformer-LSTM) methodological framework to address the challenges of component complexity and transient fluctuations in power load sequences. The framework initiates with CEEMDAN-based signal decomposition, which dissects the original load sequence into multiple intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) characterized by different temporal scales and frequencies, enabling differentiated processing of heterogeneous signal components. A subsequent application of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) extracts discriminative frequency-domain features, thereby enriching the feature space with spectral information. The architecture employs an iTransformer module with multi-head self-attention mechanisms to capture high-frequency patterns in the most volatile IMFs, while a gated recurrent unit (LSTM) specializes in modeling low-frequency components with longer temporal dependencies. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed framework achieves superior performance with an average 80% improvement in R-squared ((Formula presented.)), 40.1% lower Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and 54.1% reduced Mean Squared Error (RMSE) compared to other models. This advancement provides a robust computational tool for power grid operators, enabling optimal resource dispatch through enhanced prediction accuracy to reduce operational costs.

Although many load forecasting methods have emerged in recent years, these methods face two significant challenges: effectively capturing the impact of special events on load and requiring a substantial amount of historical data for model training. To better apply day-ahead load forecasting (DALF) to the optimal scheduling of EVs’ coordinated charging, we propose a Transformer-based network architecture combining transfer learning and multi-attention fusion. The core idea of this algorithm comprehensively considers the dependencies between special events, seasonality, and load through multi-attention fusion. Simultaneously, by introducing time series decomposition block (TSDBlock), the load data is decomposed into seasonal and trend components to effectively extract crucial information, enhancing the performance of load forecasting models. To address data scarcity issues, we introduce transfer learning, selecting the best-performing model on the target task as the source model to avoid negative transfer effects.

Traditional forecasting methods often struggle to capture long-term dependencies. Additionally, extracting complex nonlinear features from data remains a significant challenge, making it challenging to meet the accuracy demands of modern power systems. Besides, current deep learning-based forecasting methods cannot simulate multi-granularity power load data. To address these challenges, this paper presents a Generative Pre-trained Transformer model, GPT4PLTS, designed for power data simulation and fine-grained power load forecasting. The model leverages the Transformer architecture, incorporating the first six layers of the GPT decoder structure. It utilizes a multi-head attention mechanism to extract temporal features and includes a time alignment layer to maintain the sequence of time-series data, addressing both short-term and long-term dependencies. Extensive experiments are conducted on load observations from 2000 enterprises. The results demonstrate that GPT4PLTS achieves high accuracy in data simulation and forecasts across different time granularities, particularly excelling in short and medium-term predictions.

	abstract = {With the rapid development of industrial automation and intelligence, the consumption of resources and the environmental impact of production processes cannot today be ignored. Today, natural gas, as a commonly used energy source, produces significantly lower emissions of carbon dioxide, sulphur dioxide, and nitrogen oxides from combustion than coal and oil, and can be further purified to remove the small amount of impurities it contains, such as sulphur compounds. Therefore, purified natural gas (hereinafter referred to as purified gas), as a clean energy source, plays an important role in realising sustainable development. At the same time, It becomes more and more important to dispatch purified gas resources reasonably and accurately, and the paramount factor is that the load of purified gas needs to be predicted accurately. Therefore, this paper proposes a Transformer–GRU-based hourly prediction model for purified gas. The model uses the Transformer model for data fusion and feature extraction, and then combines the time series processing capability of the Gate Recurrent Unit (GRU) model to capture long-term dependencies and short-term dynamic changes in time series data. In this paper, the purified gas load data of Chongqing Municipality in 2020 was first preprocessed, and then divided into daily and hourly load datasets according to the measurement step. Meanwhile, considering the influence of temperature factor, the experimental dataset is subdivided according to whether it includes temperature data or not, and then the Transformer–GRU model was built for prediction, respectively. The results show that, compared with the Dual-Stage Attention-Based Recurrent Neural Network (DA-RNN) and the Transformer and GRU models alone, the Transformer–GRU model exhibits good performance in terms of the coefficient of determination, the average absolute percentage error, and mean square error, which can well meet the requirement of hourly prediction accuracy and has greater application value. © 2025 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Accurately forecasting the short-term traction load of railways is of great significance for optimizing the operation and dispatching of railway departments and ensuring the safety of power grids. The strong volatility and randomness of railway load signals make it difficult for traditional short-term load forecasting models to achieve high-precision predictions. To this end, this paper proposes a hybrid deep learning model with high temporal resolution characteristics to improve the accuracy of railway load forecasting. Variational mode decomposition (VMD) is used to decompose the original load sequence to reduce its volatility and forecasting difficulty, and its parameters are optimized by the improved beluga whale optimization (IBWO) algorithm. The Kolomogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) model is used to extract intricate spatial features from load data, aiming to enhance the efficiency and precision of feature extraction. The Informer model is used to extract long-term dependencies of sequences, aiming to improve the shortcomings of traditional methods that are difficult to effectively achieve modeling of ultra long time series. The advantage of the proposed forecasting method is to improve forecasting accuracy while reducing the difficulty of model deployment. The experimental results based on a real dataset from a substation on the Longhai Railway show that the VMD algorithm optimized by IBWO effectively improves the forecasting accuracy of the proposed method.

Nevertheless, conventional load prediction techniques often suffer from issues such as limited accuracy and high volatility. To overcome these limitations, this study presents a load prediction approach based on Transformer multi-model fusion, employing a Stacking ensemble learning framework to integrate multiple models, including Transformer, XGBoost, and GDBT. The method also takes into account key influencing factors, such as meteorological conditions and holidays. Specifically, it involves training and predicting from the original features, followed by utilizing Transformer’s self-attention mechanism to capture feature relationships and long-term dependencies, ultimately leading to more precise load predictions. Empirical results validate that the proposed approach achieves superior prediction accuracy and stability across multiple datasets, demonstrating significant improvements over single-model approaches and conventional techniques. © The Author(s) 2025.},

	abstract = {Efficient and accurate multi-energy load forecasting is crucial for achieving supply–demand balance in regional integrated energy systems(RIES). Existing research primarily focuses on modeling the coupling between different loads, with limited consideration of modeling from the perspective of sequential temporal information. Excessive emphasis on load coupling can lead to reduced accuracy in long-term load forecasting for RIES. To address this issue, this paper proposes a trend and periodicity feature-enhanced decoupling prediction framework to fully capture the long-term dependency relationship within sequences. Firstly, load data usually has significant trends and seasonal variations, and by decomposing load data into trend and seasonal features, it is possible to forecast for different patterns of change. Next, a decoupling prediction framework is proposed that adequately considers sequential temporal information, trend information, and seasonal information. The proposed framework enables accurate predictions for electricity load, cooling load, and heating load. Finally, comprehensive and extensive validation of the proposed prediction method is conducted using actual data from RIES. The comparative results demonstrate that the method proposed in this paper outperforms other Transformer-based model algorithms, with average improvements of 20.8%, 24.5%, and 21.7% in the evaluation metrics for electricity load, cooling load, and heating load forecasting, respectively, indicating superior predictive accuracy and wider applicability. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {In smart cities, sustainable development depends on energy load prediction since it directs utilities in effectively planning, distributing and generating energy. This work presents a novel hybrid deep learning model including components of the Improved-convolutional neural network (CNN), bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM), Graph neural network (GNN), Transformer and Fusion Layer architectures for precise energy load forecasting. Better feature extraction results from the Improved-CNN's dilated convolution and residual block accommodation of wide receptive fields reduced the vanishing gradient problem. By capturing temporal links in both directions, Bi-LSTM networks help to better grasp complicated energy use patterns. Graph neural networks improve predictive capacities across linked systems by characterizing the spatial relationships between energy-consuming units in smart cities. Emphasizing critical trends to guarantee reliable forecasts, transformer models use attention methods to manage long-term dependencies in energy consumption data. Combining CNN, Bi-LSTM, Transformer and GNN component predictions in a Fusion Layer synthesizes numerous data representations to increase accuracy. With Root Mean Square Error of 5.7532 Wh, Mean Absolute Percentage Error of 3.5001%, Mean Absolute Error of 6.7532 Wh and R<sup>2</sup> of 0.9701, the hybrid model fared better than other models on the ‘Electric Power Consumption’ Kaggle dataset.

	abstract = {Accurate short-term load forecasting is critical for enhancing the reliability and stability of regional smart energy systems. However, the inherent challenges posed by the substantial fluctuations and volatility in electricity load patterns necessitate the development of advanced forecasting techniques. In this study, a novel short-term load forecasting approach based on a two-stage feature extraction process and a hybrid inverted Transformer model is proposed. Initially, the Prophet method is employed to extract essential features such as trends, seasonality and holiday patterns from the original load dataset. Subsequently, variational mode decomposition (VMD) optimized by the IVY algorithm is utilized to extract significant periodic features from the residual component obtained by Prophet. The extracted features from both stages are then integrated to construct a comprehensive data matrix. This matrix is then inputted into a hybrid deep learning model that combines an inverted Transformer (iTransformer), temporal convolutional networks (TCNs) and a multilayer perceptron (MLP) for accurate short-term load forecasting. A thorough evaluation of the proposed method is conducted through four sets of comparative experiments using data collected from the Elia grid in Belgium. Experimental results illustrate the superior performance of the proposed approach, demonstrating high forecasting accuracy and robustness, highlighting its potential in ensuring the stable operation of regional smart energy systems. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Accurate net load forecasting contributes to increasing the integration of renewable energy sources and reducing the operating cost of the power grid. In recent years, deep learning models have been applied in net load forecasting. However, there is still a large scope for them to improve the extraction of complex multi-scale temporal features in the net load. In addition, most researches do not establish explicit mechanisms to consider the impact of relevant factors on net load forecasting, such as renewable energy outputs and load demand. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a multivariate Transformer-based model, named TCAMS-Trans, to achieve direct net load forecasting. First, TCAMS-Trans exploits multi-scale patch-based variable-independent embedding to model potential multi-scale patterns in the load data. Subsequently, TCAMS-Trans designs a new hierarchical encoder–decoder pair configured with temporal-channel attention block (TCA block) to further extract multi-scale features and capture the connections between the net load and the relevant factors. The temporal attention in TCA block is used to mine complex temporal dependency along the time dimension, and the channel attention is used to capture the inter-variable dependency along the variable dimension. Experiments conducted on three publicly available datasets show that TCAMS-Trans has higher prediction accuracy than the current state-of-the-art models at different prediction lengths. The model proposed in this paper provides a new powerful solution for net load forecasting. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The development of accurate and reliable gas load forecasting models is critical to residential safety and gas company economics. However, since the seq2seq neural network conveys information by sequentially updating the hidden states, when processing gas load data, the information needs to be passed several times before it can affect the prediction results at subsequent time steps. This can lead to a lack of ability of the model to capture long-term dependencies. To address the above issues, we propose a novel compound framework. Time-enhanced perception transformer (TEPT) in the framework achieves parallel computation of historical data and stronger location awareness through convolutional self-attention and improved attention scores. This results in better capture of local patterns and long-term dependencies in gas loads. In addition, the framework proposes two-stage feature extraction (TSFE) for decomposing the important parts of the original information and extracting more refined features based on them. We constructed a real gas load data set from Wuxi, China to verify the effectiveness. The results show that MAE, MAPE, and RMSE of the proposed method are 3.45, 1.07%, and 4.68, which provide higher accuracy compared to other prediction methods. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Short-term load forecasting (STLF) plays a vital role in ensuring the safe, efficient, and economical operation of power systems. Accurate load forecasting provides numerous benefits for power suppliers, such as cost reduction, increased reliability, and informed decision-making. However, STLF is a complex task due to various factors, including non-linear trends, multiple seasonality, variable variance, and significant random interruptions in electricity demand time series. To address these challenges, advanced techniques and models are required. This study focuses on the development of an efficient short-term power load forecasting model using the random forest (RF) algorithm. RF combines regression trees through bagging and random subspace techniques to improve prediction accuracy and reduce model variability. The algorithm constructs a forest of trees using bootstrap samples and selects random feature subsets at each node to enhance diversity. Hyperparameters such as the number of trees, minimum sample leaf size, and maximum features for each split are tuned to optimize forecasting results. The proposed model was tested using historical hourly load data from four transformer substations supplying different campus areas of the University of Beira Interior, Portugal. The training data were from January 2018 to December 2021, while the data from 2022 were used for testing. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the RF model in forecasting short-term hourly and one day ahead load and its potential to enhance decision-making processes in smart grid operations. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The penetration of electric vehicles (EV) has been increasing rapidly in recent years. Electric vehicle charging load poses a huge demand on the power grids. The forecasting for electric vehicle charging load, especially for the charging load of EV charging stations, is of significant importance for the safe operation of power grids. However, most of the existing forecasting methods fail to capture the long-term dependencies efficiently and assume the availability of a large amount of training data. Hence, they cannot address newly built charging stations with scarce historical charging load data. Meanwhile, most of the methods focus on point forecasting, which lacks risk consideration. In this work, we aim to leverage the benefits of Transformer-based models for EV charging forecasting. Specifically, we propos Probformer, a Transformer-based forecasting model for charging load forecasting. To enable Probformer to adapt fast to unseen environments, we further extend it to MetaProbformer, a meta-learning-based forecasting framework. Extensive experiments have been done on real-world datasets for both point forecasting and probabilistic forecasting. Experimental results show that our methods can consistently outperform baseline methods by a large margin. © 2000-2011 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Electrical energy is essential in today's society. Accurate electrical load forecasting is beneficial for better scheduling of electricity generation and saving electrical energy. In this paper, we propose an adaptive deep-learning load forecasting framework by integrating Transformer and domain knowledge (Adaptive-TgDLF). Adaptive-TgDLF introduces the deep-learning model Transformer and adaptive learning methods (including transfer learning for different locations and online learning for different time periods), which captures the long-term dependency of the load series, and is more appropriate for realistic scenarios with scarce samples and variable data distributions. Under the theory-guided framework, the electrical load is divided into dimensionless trends and local fluctuations. The dimensionless trends are considered as the inherent pattern of the load, and the local fluctuations are considered to be determined by the external driving forces. Adaptive learning can cope with the change of load in location and time, and can make full use of load data at different locations and times to train a more efficient model. Cross-validation experiments on different districts show that Adaptive-TgDLF is approximately 16% more accurate than the previous TgDLF model and saves more than half of the training time. Adaptive-TgDLF with 50% weather noise has the same accuracy as the previous TgDLF model without noise, which proves its robustness. We also preliminarily mine the interpretability of Transformer in Adaptive-TgDLF, which may provide future potential for better theory guidance. Furthermore, experiments demonstrate that transfer learning can accelerate convergence of the model in half the number of training epochs and achieve better performance, and online learning enables the model to achieve better results on the changing load. © 2023},

	abstract = {Load demand prediction for mid or long-term horizons is important for the development of any model for electric power system planning. Literature on this topic is much scarcer than short-term forecasting, mainly due to the inherent difficulties in long-term modelling. The aim of this paper is to develop a general multi-rate methodology in order to forecast optimally load demand series sampled at an hourly rate for a mid-term horizon. This method may be considered as an extension of a previously published short-term approach to predict load and prices based on unobserved components. This approach implies the estimation of different models for the same data sampled at different rates (monthly and hourly in this paper). Each model incorporates the appropriate features of the data for its respective sampling interval, and both types of forecasts are integrated in one single forecast by efficient time aggregation techniques that result natural to implement in a State Space framework. The procedure is evaluated by a thorough forecasting experiment in which 365 rolling sets of one hour up to 12 weeks ahead of hourly forecasts are produced for the load demand registered at a transformer of a UK company. The results show that this method produces a notable reduction on the prediction error and its variability. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},
